philosophy, which, if
it were performed suitable to the
dignity of the subject, might
not be a present unworthy the
acceptance of the greatest person. For his philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
operations of nature, which for so many ages
had imployed the curiosity of mankind; though
no one before him was furnished with the
strength of mind necessary to go any depth in
this difficult search. However, I am encouraged
to hope, that this attempt, imperfect as it is, to
give our countrymen in general some conception
of the labours of a person, who shall always
be the boast of this nation, may be received
with indulgence by one, under whose
influence these kingdoms enjoy so much happiness.
Indeed my admiration at the surprizing
inventions of this great man, carries me to conceive
of him as a person, who not only must
raise the glory of the country, which gave him
birth; but that he has even done honour to human
nature, by having extended the greatest
and most noble of our faculties, reason, to subjects,
which, till he attempted them, appeared
to be wholly beyond the reach of our limited
capacities.  And what can give us a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
more pleasing prospect of our own condition,
than to see so exalted a proof of the strength
of that faculty, whereon the conduct of our
lives, and our happiness depends; our passions
and all our motives to action being in such
manner guided by our opinions, that where
these are just, our whole behaviour will be
praise-worthy? But why do I presume to detain
you, <span class="smcap">Sir</span>, with such reflections as these,
who must have the fullest experience within
your own mind, of the effects of right reason?
For to what other source can be ascribed that
amiable frankness and unreserved condescension
among your friends, or that masculine perspicuity
and strength of argument, whereby you draw
the admiration of the publick, while you are
engaged in the most important of all causes,
the liberties of mankind?</p>

<p class="p2">I humbly crave leave to make the only acknowledgement

<h2 class="p4"><em class="gesperrt">PREFACE</em>.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap00">I <i>Drew up the following papers many years ago at the desire of
some friends, who, upon my taking care of the late edition of
Sir</i> <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton’s</span></em> <i>Principia, perswaded me to make them
publick. I laid hold of that opportunity, when my thoughts
were afresh employed on this subject, to revise what I had formerly
written. And I now send it abroad not without some hopes of answering
these two ends. My first intention was to convey to such, as are not
used to mathematical reasoning, some idea of the philosophy of a person,
who has acquired an universal reputation, and rendered our nation
famous for these speculations in the learned world. To which purpose
I have avoided using terms of art as much as possible, and taken
care to define such as I was obliged to use. Though this caution
was the less necessary at present, since many of them are become familiar
words to our language, from the great number of books wrote
in it upon philosophical subjects, and the courses of experiments, that
have of late years been given by several ingenious men. The other
view I had, was to encourage such young gentlemen as have a turn for
the mathematical sciences, to pursue those studies the more chearfully,
in order to understand in our author himself the demonstrations of the
things I here declare. And to facilitate their progress herein, I intend
to proceed still farther in the explanation of Sir</i> <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton’s</span></em>
<i>philosophy. For as I have received very much pleasure from
perusing his writings, I hope it is no illaudable ambition to endeavour
the rendering them more easily understood, that greater numbers may
enjoy the same satisfaction.</i></p>

<p><i>It will perhaps be expected, that I should say something particular
of a person, to whom I must always acknowledge my self to be much
obliged. What I have to declare on this head will be but short; for
it was in the very last years of Sir</i> <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac</span></em><i>’s life, that I had the honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
of his acquaintance. This happened on the following occasion.
Mr.</i> Polenus, <i>a Professor in the University of</i> Padua, <i>from a new experiment
of his, thought the common opinion about the force of moving
bodies was overturned, and the truth of Mr.</i> Libnitz<i>’s notion in that
matter fully proved. The contrary of what Polenus had asserted I
demonstrated in a paper, which Dr.</i> <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Mead</span></em>, <i>who takes all opportunities
of obliging his friends, was pleased to shew Sir</i> <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em>
<i>This was so well approved of by him, that he did me the honour
to become a fellow-writer with me, by annexing to what I had
written, a demonstration of his own drawn from another consideration.
When I printed my discourse in the philosophical transactions, I
put what Sir</i> <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac</span></em> <i>had written in a scholium by it self, that I
might not seem to usurp what did not belong to me. But I concealed
his name, not being then sufficiently acquainted with him to ask whether
he was willing I might make use of it or not. In a little time
after he engaged me to take care of the new edition he was about
making if his Principia. This obliged me to be very frequently with
him, and as he lived at some distance from me, a great number of
letters passed between us on this account. When I had the honour of
his conversation, I endeavoured to learn his thoughts upon mathematical
subjects, and something historical concerning his inventions, that I
had not been before acquainted with. I found, he had read fewer of the
modern mathematicians, than one could have expected; but his own
prodigious invention readily supplied him with what he might have an
occasion for in the pursuit of any subject he undertook. I have often heard
him censure the handling geometrical subjects by algebraic calculations;
and his book of Algebra he called by the name of Universal Arithmetic,
in opposition to the injudicious title of Geometry, which</i> Des&nbsp;Cartes <i>had
given to the treatise, wherein he shews, how the geometer may assist his
invention by such kind of computations. He frequently praised</i> Slusius,
Barrow <i>and</i> Huygens <i>for not being influenced by the false taste, which
then began to prevail. He used to commend the laudable attempt of</i> Hugo
de&nbsp;Omerique <i>to restore the ancient analysis, and very much esteemed Apollonius’s
book De sectione rationis for giving us a clearer notion of that
analysis than we had before. Dr.</i> Barrow <i>may be esteemed as having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
shewn a compass of invention equal, if not superior to any of the
moderns, our author only excepted; but Sir</i> <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> <i>has
several times particularly recommended to me</i> Huygens<i>’s stile and
manner. He thought him the most elegant of any mathematical writer
of modern times, and the most just imitator of the antients. Of
their taste, and form of demonstration Sir</i> <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac</span></em> <i>always professed
himself a great admirer: I have heard him even censure himself for
not following them yet more closely than he did; and speak with regret
of his mistake at the beginning of his mathematical studies, in
applying himself to the works of</i> Des Cartes <i>and other algebraic writers,
before he had considered the elements of</i> Euclide <i>with that attention,
which so excellent a writer deserves. As to the history of his
inventions, what relates to his discoveries of the methods of series and
fluxions, and of his theory of light and colours, the world has been sufficiently
informed of already. The first thoughts, which gave rise
to his Principia, he had, when he retired from</i> Cambridge <i>in 1666 on
account of the plague. As he sat alone in a garden, he fell into a
speculation on the power of gravity: that as this power is not found
sensibly diminished at the remotest distance from the center of the earth,
to which we can rise, neither at the tops of the loftiest buildings, nor
even on the summits of the highest mountains; it appeared to him
reasonable to conclude, that this power must extend much farther than
was usually thought; why not as high as the moon, said he to himself?
and if so, her motion must be influenced by it; perhaps she is retained
in her orbit thereby. However, though the power of gravity
is not sensibly weakened in the little change of distance, at which we
can place our selves from the center of the earth; yet it is very possible,
that so high as the moon this power may differ much in strength from
what it is here. To make an estimate, what might be the degree of
this diminution, he considered with himself, that if the moon be retained
in her orbit by the force of gravity, no doubt the primary planets
are carried round the sun by the like power. And by comparing the
periods of the several planets with their distances from the sun, he found,
that if any power like gravity held them in their courses, its strength must
decrease in the duplicate proportion of the increase of distance. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
be concluded by supposing them to move in perfect circles concentrical
to the sun, from which the orbits of the greatest part of them do
not much differ. Supposing therefore the power of gravity, when
extended to the moon, to decrease in the same manner, he computed
whether that force would be sufficient to keep the moon in her orbit.
In this computation, being absent from books, he took the common estimate
in use among geographers and our seamen, before</i> Norwood <i>had measured
the earth, that 60 English miles were contained in one degree
of latitude on the surface of the earth. But as this is a very faulty
supposition, each degree containing about 69½ of our miles, his computation
did not answer expectation; whence he concluded, that some
other cause must at least join with the action of the power of gravity
on the moon. On this account he laid aside for that time any farther
thoughts upon this matter. But some years after, a letter which he
received from Dr.</i> Hook, <i>put him on inquiring what was the real
figure, in which a body let fall from any high place descends, taking
the motion of the earth round its axis into consideration. Such a body,
having the same motion, which by the revolution of the earth the
place has whence it falls, is to be considered as projected forward
and at the same time drawn down to the center of the earth.  This
gave occasion to his resuming his former thoughts concerning the
moon; and</i> Picart <i>in</i> France <i>having lately measured the earth, by
using his measures the moon appeared to be kept in her orbit purely
by the power of gravity; and consequently, that this power decreases
as you recede from the center of the earth in the manner our author
had formerly conjectured. Upon this principle he found the line described
by a falling body to be an ellipsis, the center of the earth being
one focus. And the primary planets moving in such orbits round
the sun, he had the satisfaction to see, that this inquiry, which he
had undertaken merely out of curiosity, could be applied to the
greatest purposes. Hereupon he composed near a dozen propositions
relating to the motion of the primary planets about the sun. Several
years after this, some discourse he had with Dr.</i> Halley, <i>who at
Cambridge made him a visit, engaged Sir</i> <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> <i>to
resume again the consideration of this subject; and gave occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
to his writing the treatise which he published under the title of mathematical
principles of natural philosophy. This treatise, full of
such a variety of profound inventions, was composed by him from
scarce any other materials than the few propositions before mentioned,
in the space of one year and an half.</i></p>

<p><i>Though his memory was much decayed, I found he perfectly understood
his own writings, contrary to what I had frequently heard
in discourse from many persons. This opinion of theirs might arise
perhaps from his not being always ready at speaking on these subjects,
when it might be expected he should. But as to this, it may be
observed, that great genius’s are frequently liable to be absent, not only
in relation to common life, but with regard to some of the parts of science
they are the best informed of. Inventors seem to treasure up in their
minds, what they have found out, after another manner than those do
the same things, who have not this inventive faculty. The former,
when they have occasion to produce their knowledge, are in some measure
obliged immediately to investigate part of what they want. For
this they are not equally fit at all times: so it has often happened,
that such as retain things chiefly by means of a very strong memory,
have appeared off hand more expert than the discoverers themselves.</i></p>

<p><i>As to the moral endowments of his mind, they were as much to be
admired as his other talents. But this is a field I leave others to
exspatiate in. I only touch upon what I experienced myself during the
few years I was happy in his friendship. But this I immediately
discovered in him, which at once both surprized and charmed me:
Neither his extreme great age, nor his universal reputation had
rendred him stiff in opinion, or in any degree elated. Of this
I had occasion to have almost daily experience. The Remarks I
continually sent him by letters on his Principia were received with
the utmost goodness. These were so far from being any ways displeasing
to him, that on the contrary it occasioned him to speak many kind
things of me to my friends, and to honour me with a publick testimony
of his good opinion. He also approved of the following treatise, a
great part of which we read together. As many alterations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
made in the late edition of his Principia, so there would have been
many more if there had been a sufficient time. But whatever of this
kind may be thought wanting, I shall endeavour to supply in my comment
on that book. I had reason to believe he expected such a thing
from me, and I intended to have published it in his life time, after I
had printed the following discourse, and a mathematical treatise Sir</i>
<em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> <i>had written a long while ago, containing the
first principles of fluxions, for I had prevailed on him to let that piece
go abroad. I had examined all the calculations, and prepared part
of the figures; but as the latter part of the treatise had never been
finished, he was about letting me have other papers, in order to
supply what was wanting. But his death put a stop to that design.
As to my comment on the Principia, I intend there to demonstrate

<p class="drop-cap04"><span class="smcap">To</span> <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Newton</span></em>’s genius, and immortal fame<br />
Th’ advent’rous muse with trembling pinion soars.<br />
Thou, heav’nly truth, from thy seraphick throne<br />
Look favourable down, do thou assist<br />
My lab’ring thought, do thou inspire my song.<br />
<span class="smcap">Newton</span>, who first th’ almighty’s works display’d,<br />
And smooth’d that mirror, in whose polish’d face<br />
The great creator now conspicuous shines;<br />
Who open’d nature’s adamantine gates,<br />
And to our minds her secret powers expos’d;<br />
<span class="smcap">Newton</span> demands the muse; his sacred hand<br />
Shall guide her infant steps; his sacred hand<br />
Shall raise her to the Heliconian height,<br />
Where, on its lofty top inthron’d, her head<br />
Shall mingle with the Stars. Hail nature, hail,<br />
O Goddess, handmaid of th’ ethereal power,<br />
Now lift thy head, and to th’ admiring world<br />
Shew thy long hidden beauty. Thee the wise<br />
Of ancient fame, immortal <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Plato</span></em>’s self,<br />

From black obscurity’s abyss to raise,<br />
(Drooping and mourning o’er thy wondrous works)<br />
With vain inquiry sought. Like meteors these<br />
In their dark age bright sons of wisdom shone:<br />
But at thy <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Newton</span></em> all their laurels fade,<br />
They shrink from all the honours of their names.<br />
So glimm’ring stars contract their feeble rays,<br />
When the swift lustre of <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Aurora</span></em>’s face<br />
Flows o’er the skies, and wraps the heav’ns in light.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Deity’s omnipotence, the cause,<br />
Th’ original of things long lay unknown.<br />
Alone the beauties prominent to sight<br />
(Of the celestial power the outward form)<br />
Drew praise and wonder from the gazing world.<br />
As when the deluge overspread the earth,<br />
Whilst yet the mountains only rear’d their heads<br />
Above the surface of the wild expanse,<br />
Whelm’d deep below the great foundations lay,<br />
Till some kind angel at heav’n’s high command<br />
Roul’d back the rising tides, and haughty floods,<br />
And to the ocean thunder’d out his voice:<br />
Quick all the swelling and imperious waves,<br />
The foaming billows and obscuring surge,<br />
Back to their channels and their ancient seats<br />
Recoil affrighted: from the darksome main<br />
Earth raises smiling, as new-born, her head,<br />
And with fresh charms her lovely face arrays.<br />
So his extensive thought accomplish’d first<br />
The mighty task to drive th’ obstructing mists<br />
Of ignorance away, beneath whose gloom<br />
Th’ inshrouded majesty of Nature lay.<br />
He drew the veil and swell’d the spreading scene.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>How had the moon around th’ ethereal void<br />
Rang’d, and eluded lab’ring mortals care,<br />
Till his invention trac’d her secret steps,<br />
While she inconstant with unsteady rein<br />
Through endless mazes and meanders guides<br />
In its unequal course her changing carr:<br />
Whether behind the sun’s superior light<br />
She hides the beauties of her radiant face,<br />
Or, when conspicuous, smiles upon mankind,<br />
Unveiling all her night-rejoicing charms.<br />
When thus the silver-tressed moon dispels<br />
The frowning horrors from the brow of night,<br />
And with her splendors chears the sullen gloom,<br />
While sable-mantled darkness with his veil<br />
The visage of the fair horizon shades,<br />
And over nature spreads his raven wings;<br />
Let me upon some unfrequented green<br />
While sleep sits heavy on the drowsy world,<br />
Seek out some solitary peaceful cell,<br />
Where darksome woods around their gloomy brows<br />
Bow low, and ev’ry hill’s protended shade<br />
Obscures the dusky vale, there silent dwell,<br />
Where contemplation holds its still abode,<br />
There trace the wide and pathless void of heav’n,<br />
And count the stars that sparkle on its robe.<br />
Or else in fancy’s wild’ring mazes lost<br />
Upon the verdure see the fairy elves<br />
Dance o’er their magick circles, or behold,<br />
In thought enraptur’d with the ancient bards,<br />
Medea’s baleful incantations draw<br />
Down from her orb the paly queen of night.<br />
But chiefly <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Newton</span></em> let me soar with thee,<br />

With admiration I attentive gaze,<br />

And waft aloft my high-aspiring mind,<br />
Shalt shew me there how nature has ordain’d<br />
Her fundamental laws, shalt lead my thought<br />
Through all the wand’rings of th’ uncertain moon,<br />
And teach me all her operating powers.<br />
She and the sun with influence conjoint<br />
Wield the huge axle of the whirling earth,<br />
And from their just direction turn the poles,<br />
Slow urging on the progress of the years.<br />
The constellations seem to leave their seats,<br />
And o’er the skies with solemn pace to move.<br />
You, splendid rulers of the day and night,<br />
The seas obey, at your resistless sway<br />
Now they contract their waters, and expose<br />
The dreary desart of old ocean’s reign.<br />
The craggy rocks their horrid sides disclose;<br />
Trembling the sailor views the dreadful scene,<br />
And cautiously the threat’ning ruin shuns.<br />
But where the shallow waters hide the sands,<br />
There ravenous destruction lurks conceal’d,<br />
There the ill-guided vessel falls a prey,<br />
And all her numbers gorge his greedy jaws.<br />
But quick returning see th’ impetuous tides<br />
Back to th’ abandon’d shores impell the main.<br />
Again the foaming seas extend their waves,<br />
Again the rouling floods embrace the shoars,<br />
And veil the horrours of the empty deep.<br />
Thus the obsequious seas your power confess,<br />
While from the surface healthful vapours rise<br />
Plenteous throughout the atmosphere diffus’d,<br />
Or to supply the mountain’s heads with springs,<br />
Or fill the hanging clouds with needful rains,<br />
That friendly streams, and kind refreshing show’rs<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>May gently lave the sun-burnt thirsty plains,<br />

How shall the feeble muse pursue through all<br />

That even seeks th’ unseen recesses dark<br />
To penetrate of providence immense.<br />
And thou the great dispenser of the world<br />
Propitious, who with inspiration taught’st<br />
Our greatest bard to send thy praises forth;<br />
Thou, who gav’st <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Newton</span></em> thought; who smil’dst serene,<br />
When to its bounds he stretch’d his swelling soul;<br />
Who still benignant ever blest his toil,<br />
And deign’d to his enlight’ned mind t’ appear<br />
Confess’d around th’ interminated world:<br />
To me O thy divine infusion grant<br />
(O thou in all so infinitely good)<br />
That I may sing thy everlasting works,<br />
Thy inexhausted store of providence,<br />
In thought effulgent and resounding verse.<br />
O could I spread the wond’rous theme around,<br />
Where the wind cools the oriental world,<br />
To the calm breezes of the Zephir’s breath,<br />
To where the frozen hyperborean blasts.<br />
To where the boist’rous tempest-leading south<br />
From their deep hollow caves send forth their storms.<br />
Thou still indulgent parent of mankind,<br />
Left humid emanations should no more<br />
Flow from the ocean, but dissolve away<br />

And left the vital principle decay,<br />
By which the air supplies the springs of life;<br />

No longer tremble at imagin’d ills,<br />

Of gravitation, by whose simple power<br />
The universe exists. Nor here the sage<br />
Big with invention still renewing staid.<br />

How shall the muse display his greatest toil?<br />
Let her plunge deep in Aganippe’s waves,<br />
Or in Castalia’s ever-flowing stream,<br />
That re-inspired she may sing to thee,<br />
How <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Newton</span></em> dar’d advent’rous to unbraid<br />
The yellow tresses of thy shining hair.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>T’ unweave the light-diffusing wreath, and part<br />
The blended glories of thy golden plumes?<br />
He with laborious, and unerring care,<br />
How different and imbodied colours form<br />
Thy piercing light, with just distinction found.<br />
He with quick sight pursu’d thy darting rays,<br />
When penetrating to th’ obscure recess<br />
Of solid matter, there perspicuous saw,<br />
How in the texture of each body lay<br />
The power that separates the different beams.<br />
Hence over nature’s unadorned face<br />
Thy bright diversifying rays dilate<br />
Their various hues: and hence when vernal rains<br />
Descending swift have burst the low’ring clouds,<br />
Thy splendors through the dissipating mists<br />
In its fair vesture of unnumber’d hues<br />
Array the show’ry bow. At thy approach<br />
The morning risen from her pearly couch<br />
With rosy blushes decks her virgin cheek;<br />
The ev’ning on the frontispiece of heav’n<br />
His mantle spreads with many colours gay;<br />
The mid-day skies in radiant azure clad,<br />
The shining clouds, and silver vapours rob’d<br />
In white transparent intermixt with gold,<br />
With bright variety of splendor cloath<br />
All the illuminated face above.<br />
When hoary-headed winter back retires<br />
To the chill’d pole, there solitary sits<br />
Encompass’d round with winds and tempests bleak<br />
In caverns of impenetrable ice,<br />
And from behind the dissipated gloom<br />
Like a new Venus from the parting surge<br />
The gay-apparell’d spring advances on;<br />
When thou in thy meridian brightness sitt’st,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>And from thy throne pure emanations flow<br />
Of glory bursting o’er the radiant skies:<br />
Then let the muse Olympus’ top ascend,<br />
And o’er Thessalia’s plain extend her view,<br />
And count, O Tempe, all thy beauties o’er.<br />
Mountains, whose summits grasp the pendant clouds,<br />
Between their wood-invelop’d slopes embrace<br />
The green-attired vallies. Every flow’r<br />
Here in the pride of bounteous nature clad<br />
Smiles on the bosom of th’ enamell’d meads.<br />
Over the smiling lawn the silver floods<br />
Of fair Peneus gently roul along,<br />
While the reflected colours from the flow’rs,<br />
And verdant borders pierce the lympid waves,<br />
And paint with all their variegated hue<br />
The yellow sands beneath. Smooth gliding on<br />
The waters hasten to the neighbouring sea.<br />
Still the pleas’d eye the floating plain pursues;<br />
At length, in Neptune’s wide dominion lost,<br />
Surveys the shining billows, that arise<br />
Apparell’d each in Phœbus’ bright attire:<br />
Or from a far some tall majestick ship,<br />
Or the long hostile lines of threat’ning fleets,<br />
Which o’er the bright uneven mirror sweep,<br />
In dazling gold and waving purple deckt;<br />
Such as of old, when haughty Athens power<br />
Their hideous front, and terrible array<br />
Against Pallene’s coast extended wide,<br />
And with tremendous war and battel stern<br />
The trembling walls of Potidæa shook.<br />
Crested with pendants curling with the breeze<br />
The upright masts high bristle in the air,<br />
Aloft exalting proud their gilded heads.<br />
The silver waves against the painted prows<br />

Around the main a gleaming horrour casts;<br />
Each flaming buckler like the mid-day sun,<br />
Each plumed helmet like the silver moon,<br />
Each moving gauntlet like the light’ning’s blaze,<br />
And like a star each brazen pointed spear.<br />
But lo the sacred high-erected fanes,<br />
Fair citadels, and marble-crowned towers,<br />

Magnificent arise, upon their heads<br />
Bearing on high a wreath of silver light.<br />
But see my muse the high Pierian hill,<br />
Behold its shaggy locks and airy top,<br />
Up to the skies th’ imperious mountain heaves<br />
The shining verdure of the nodding woods.<br />
See where the silver Hippocrene flows,<br />
Behold each glitt’ring rivulet, and rill<br />

When harmony in ever-pleasing strains,<br />
Melodious melting at each lulling fall,<br />

<p class="cap13">THE manner, in which Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em>
has published his philosophical discoveries,
occasions them to lie very much
concealed from all, who have not made
the mathematics particularly their study.
He once, indeed, intended to deliver,
in a more familiar way, that part
of his inventions, which relates to the system of the world;
but upon farther consideration he altered his design. For as
the nature of those discoveries made it impossible to prove
them upon any other than geometrical principles; he apprehended,
that those, who should not fully perceive the force
of his arguments, would hardly be prevailed on to exchange
their former sentiments for new opinions, so very different from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
what were commonly received<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. He therefore chose rather
to explain himself only to mathematical readers; and declined
the attempting to instruct such in any of his principles, who,
by not comprehending his method of reasoning, could not, at
the first appearance of his discoveries, have been persuaded of
their truth. But now, since Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em>’s doctrine
has been fully established by the unanimous approbation of all,
who are qualified to understand the same; it is without doubt
to be wished, that the whole of his improvements in philosophy
might be universally known. For this purpose therefore
I drew up the following papers, to give a general notion of our
great philosopher’s inventions to such, as are not prepared to
read his own works, and yet might desire to be informed of
the progress, he has made in natural knowledge; not doubting
but there were many, besides those, whose turn of mind had
led them into a course of mathematical studies, that would take
great pleasure in tasting of this delightful fountain of science.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is a just remark, which has been made upon the human
mind, that nothing is more suitable to it, than the contemplation
of truth; and that all men are moved with a strong
desire after knowledge; esteeming it honourable to excel
therein; and holding it, on the contrary, disgraceful to mistake,
err, or be in any way deceived. And this sentiment
is by nothing more fully illustrated, than by the inclination
of men to gain an acquaintance with the operations of nature;
which disposition to enquire after the causes of things is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
so general, that all men of letters, I believe, find themselves
influenced by it. Nor is it difficult to assign a reason for this,
if we consider only, that our desire after knowledge is an effect
of that taste for the sublime and the beautiful in things,
which chiefly constitutes the difference between the human
life, and the life of brutes. These inferior animals partake
with us of the pleasures, that immediately flow from the bodily
senses and appetites; but our minds are furnished with a
superior sense, by which we are capable of receiving various
degrees of delight, where the creatures below us perceive no
difference. Hence arises that pursuit of grace and elegance in
our thoughts and actions, and in all things belonging to us,
which principally creates imployment for the active mind of
man. The thoughts of the human mind are too extensive
to be confined only to the providing and enjoying of what is
necessary for the support of our being. It is this taste, which
has given rise to poetry, oratory, and every branch of literature
and science. From hence we feel great pleasure in conceiving
strongly, and in apprehending clearly, even where
the passions are not concerned. Perspicuous reasoning appears
not only beautiful; but, when set forth in its full
strength and dignity, it partakes of the sublime, and not
only pleases, but warms and elevates the soul. This is the
source of our strong desire of knowledge; and the same
taste for the sublime and the beautiful directs us to chuse
particularly the productions of nature for the subject of our
contemplation: our creator having so adapted our minds to
the condition, wherein he has placed us, that all his visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
works, before we inquire into their make, strike us with
the most lively ideas of beauty and magnificence.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> if there be so strong a passion in contemplative
minds for natural philosophy; all such must certainly receive a
particular pleasure in being informed of Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em>’s
discoveries, who alone has been able to make any great
advancements in the true course leading to natural knowledge:
whereas this important subject had before been usually
attempted with that negligence, as cannot be reflected
on without surprize. Excepting a very few, who, by
pursuing a more rational method, had gained a little true
knowledge in some particular parts of nature; the writers in
this science had generally treated of it after such a manner, as
if they thought, that no degree of certainty was ever to be hoped
for. The custom was to frame conjectures; and if upon
comparing them with things, there appeared some kind of agreement,
though very imperfect, it was held sufficient. Yet
at the same time nothing less was undertaken than intire systems,
and fathoming at once the greatest depths of nature;
as if the secret causes of natural effects, contrived and framed
by infinite wisdom, could be searched out by the slightest
endeavours of our weak understandings. Whereas the only
method, that can afford us any prospect of success in this
difficult work, is to make our enquiries with the utmost
caution, and by very slow degrees. And after our most diligent
labour, the greatest part of nature will, no doubt, for ever
remain beyond our reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> neglect of the proper means to enlarge our
knowledge, joined with the presumption to attempt, what
was quite out of the power of our limited faculties, the Lord
<span class="smcap">Bacon</span> judiciously observes to be the great obstruction to the
progress of science<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. Indeed that excellent person was the first,
who expresly writ against this way of philosophizing; and he
has laid open at large the absurdity of it in his admirable treatise,
intitled <span class="smcap">Novum organon scientiarum</span>; and has there
likewise described the true method, which ought to be followed.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> are, saith he, but two methods, that can be
taken in the pursuit of natural knowledge. One is to make
a hasty transition from our first and slight observations on
things to general axioms, and then to proceed upon those
axioms, as certain and uncontestable principles, without farther
examination. The other method; (which he observes
to be the only true one, but to his time unattempted;) is to
proceed cautiously, to advance step by step, reserving the
most general principles for the last result of our inquiries<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.
Concerning the first of these two methods; where objections,
which happen to appear against any such axioms taken up in
haste, are evaded by some frivolous distinction, when the axiom
it self ought rather to be corrected<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; he affirms, that
the united endeavours of all ages cannot make it successful;
because this original error in the first digestion of the mind
(as he expresses himself) cannot afterwards be remedied<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>:
whereby he would signify to us, that if we set out in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
wrong way; no diligence or art, we can use, while we
follow so erroneous a course, will ever bring us to our designed
end. And doubtless it cannot prove otherwise; for
in this spacious field of nature, if once we forsake the true
path, we shall immediately lose our selves, and must for
ever wander with uncertainty.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> impossibility of succeeding in so faulty a method
of philosophizing his Lordship endeavours to prove from the
many false notions and prejudices, to which the mind of man
is exposed<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. And since this judicious writer apprehends, that
men are so exceeding liable to fall into these wrong tracts of
thinking, as to incur great danger of being misled by them,
even while they enter on the true course in pursuit of nature<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>;
I trust, I shall be excused, if, by insisting a little particularly
upon this argument, I endeavour to remove whatever
prejudice of this kind, might possibly entangle the mind
of any of my readers.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">His</span> Lordship has reduced these prejudices and false
modes of conception under four distinct heads<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> first head contains such, as we are subject to from
the very condition of humanity, through the weakness both
of our senses, and of the faculties of the mind<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; seeing, as
this author well observes, the subtilty of nature far exceeds
the greatest subtilty of our senses or acutest reasonings<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of the false modes of conception, which he mentions under
this head, is the forming to our selves a fanciful simplicity
and regularity in natural things. This he illustrates
by the following instances; the conceiving the planets to
move in perfect circles; the adding an orb of fire to the other
three elements, and the supposing each of these to exceed
the other in rarity, just in a decuple proportion<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.
And of the same nature is the assertion of <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Des Cartes</em></span>,
without any proof, that all things are made up of three
kinds of matter only<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. As also this opinion of another
philosopher; that light, in passing through different mediums,
was refracted, so as to proceed by that way, through
which it would move more speedily, than through any other<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.
The second erroneous turn of mind, taken notice of
by his Lordship under this head, is, that all men are in some
degree prone to a fondness for any notions, which they have
once imbibed; whereby they often wrest things to reconcile
them to those notions, and neglect the consideration of whatever
will not be brought to an agreement with them; just as
those do, who are addicted to judicial astrology, to the observation
of dreams, and to such-like superstitions; who carefully
preserve the memory of every incident, which serves to
confirm their prejudices, and let slip out of their minds all instances,
that make against them<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. There is also a farther impediment
to true knowledge, mentioned under the same head by
this noble writer, which is; that whereas, through the weakness
and imperfection of our senses, many things are concealed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
from us, which have the greatest effect in producing natural
appearances; our minds are ordinarily most affected by
that, which makes the strongest impression on our organs
of sense; whereby we are apt to judge of the real importance
of things in nature by a wrong measure<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. So, because
the figuration and the motion of bodies strike our senses more
immediately than most of their other properties, <span class="smcap">Des Cartes</span>
and his followers will not allow any other explication of natural
appearances, than from the figure and motion of the parts
of matter. By which example we see how justly his Lordship
observes this cause of error to be the greatest of any<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>;
since it has given rise to a fundamental principle in a system
of philosophy, that not long ago obtained almost an universal
reputation.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> are the chief branches of those obstructions to
knowledge, which this author has reduced under his first
head of false conceptions. The second head contains the
errors, to which particular persons are more especially obnoxious<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.
One of these is the consequence of a preceding observation:
that as we are exposed to be captivated by any opinions,
which have once taken possession of our minds; so in
particular, natural knowledge has been much corrupted by
the strong attachment of men to some one part of science,
of which they reputed themselves the inventers, or about
which they have spent much of their time; and hence have
been apt to conceive it to be of greater use in the study of natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
philosophy than it was: like <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>, who reduced
his physics to logical disputations; and the chymists, who
thought, that nature could be laid open only by the force
of their fires<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. Some again are wholly carried away by an
excessive veneration for antiquity; others, by too great fondness
for the moderns; few having their minds so well balanced,
as neither to depreciate the merit of the ancients, nor yet to
despise the real improvements of later times<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. To this is
added by his Lordship a difference in the genius of men,
that some are most fitted to observe the similitude, there is in
things, while others are more qualified to discern the particulars,
wherein they disagree; both which dispositions of
mind are useful: but to the prejudice of philosophy men are
apt to run into excess in each; while one sort of genius dwells
too much upon the gross and sum of things, and the other
upon trifling minutenesses and shadowy distinctions<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Under</span> the third head of prejudices and false notions
this writer considers such, as follow from the lax and indefinite
use of words in ordinary discourse; which occasions great
ambiguities and uncertainties in philosophical debates (as another
eminent philosopher has since shewn more at large<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>;) insomuch
that this our author thinks a strict defining of terms to
be scarce an infallible remedy against this inconvenience<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. And
perhaps he has no small reason on his side: for the common
inaccurate sense of words, notwithstanding the limitations
given them by definitions, will offer it self so constantly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the mind, as to require great caution and circumspection
for us not to be deceived thereby. Of this we have a very
eminent instance in the great disputes, that have been raised
about the use of the word attraction in philosophy; of which
we shall be obliged hereafter to make particular mention<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.
Words thus to be guarded against are of two kinds. Some
are names of things, that are only imaginary<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; such words
are wholly to be rejected. But there are other terms, that allude
to what is real, though their signification is confused<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.
And these latter must of necessity be continued in use; but
their sense cleared up, and freed, as much as possible, from
obscurity.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> last general head of these errors comprehends
such, as follow from the various sects of false philosophies;
which this author divides into three sorts, the sophistical, empirical,
and superstitious<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. By the first of these he means
a philosophy built upon speculations only without experiments<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>;
by the second, where experiments are blindly adhered
to, without proper reasoning upon them<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; and by
the third, wrong opinions of nature fixed in mens minds either
through false religions, or from misunderstanding the
declarations of the true<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> are the four principal canals, by which this judicious
author thinks, that philosophical errors have flowed in
upon us. And he rightly observes, that the faulty method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
proceeding in philosophy, against which he writes<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, is so far
from assisting us towards overcoming these prejudices; that
he apprehends it rather suited to rivet them more firmly to the
mind<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. How great reason then has his Lordship to call this
way of philosophizing the parent of error, and the bane of
all knowledge<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>? For, indeed, what else but mistakes can so
bold and presumptuous a treatment of nature produce? have
we the wisdom necessary to frame a world, that we should
think so easily, and with so slight a search to enter into the most
secret springs of nature, and discover the original causes of
things? what chimeras, what monsters has not this preposterous
method brought forth? what schemes, or what hypothesis’s
of the subtilest wits has not a stricter enquiry into nature not
only overthrown, but manifested to be ridiculous and absurd?
Every new improvement, which we make in this science, lets
us see more and more the weakness of our guesses. Dr. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Harvey</span>,
by that one discovery of the circulation of the blood, has
dissipated all the speculations and reasonings of many ages upon
the animal oeconomy. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Asellius</span>, by detecting the lacteal
veins, shewed how little ground all physicians and philosophers
had in conjecturing, that the nutritive part of the
aliment was absorbed by the mouths of the veins spread upon
the bowels: and then <span class="smcap">Pecquet</span>, by finding out the thoracic
duct, as evidently proved the vanity of the opinion, which
was persisted in after the lacteal vessels were known, that the
alimental juice was conveyed immediately to the liver, and
there converted into blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">As</span> these things set forth the great absurdity of proceeding
in philosophy on conjectures, by informing us how far
the operations of nature are above our low conceptions; so
on the other hand, such instances of success from a more
judicious method shew us, that our bountiful maker has
not left us wholly without means of delighting our selves in
the contemplation of his wisdom.  That by a just way of
inquiry into nature, we could not fail of arriving at discoveries
very remote from our apprehensions; the Lord <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Bacon</em></span> himself
argues from the experience of mankind. If, says he, the
force of guns should be described to any one ignorant of
them, by their effects only, he might reasonably suppose, that
those engines of destruction were only a more artificial composition,
than he knew, of wheels and other mechanical
powers: but it could never enter his thoughts, that their
immense force should be owing to a peculiar substance,
which would enkindle into so violent an explosion, as we
experience in gunpowder: since he would no where see
the least example of any such operation; except perhaps in
earthquakes and thunder, which he would doubtless look
upon as exalted powers of nature, greatly surpassing any art of
man to imitate. In the same manner, if a stranger to the original
of silk were shewn a garment made of it, he would be
very far from imagining so strong a substance to be spun out
of the bowels of a small worm; but must certainly believe
it either a vegetable substance, like flax or cotton; or the natural
covering of some animal, as wool is of sheep. Or had
we been told, before the invention of the magnetic needle
among us, that another people was in possession of a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
contrivance, by which they were inabled to discover the position
of the heavens, with vastly more ease, than we could
do; what could have been imagined more, than that they
were provided with some fitter astronomical instrument for
this purpose than we? That any stone should have so amazing
a property, as we find in the magnet, must have been
the remotest from our thoughts<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> what surprizing advancements in the knowledge
of nature may be made by pursuing the true course in philosophical
inquiries; when those searches are conducted by a
genius equal to so divine a work, will be best understood by
considering Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> discoveries. That my’s
reader may apprehend as just a notion of these, as can be conveyed
to him, by the brief account, which I intend to lay before
him; I have set apart this introduction for explaining, in
the fullest manner I am able, the principles, whereon Sir
<em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> proceeds. For without a clear conception
of these, it is impossible to form any true idea of the
singular excellence of the inventions of this great philosopher.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> principles then of this philosophy are; upon no consideration
to indulge conjectures concerning the powers and
laws of nature, but to make it our endeavour with all diligence
to search out the real and true laws, by which the constitution
of things is regulated. The philosopher’s first care must be
to distinguish, what he sees to be within his power, from what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
is beyond his reach; to assume no greater degree of knowledge,
than what he finds himself possessed of; but to advance
by slow and cautious steps; to search gradually into natural causes;
to secure to himself the knowledge of the most immediate
cause of each appearance, before he extends his views farther
to causes more remote. This is the method, in which philosophy
ought to be cultivated; which does not pretend to so great
things, as the more airy speculations; but will perform abundantly
more: we shall not perhaps seem to the unskilful to
know so much, but our real knowledge will be greater. And
certainly it is no objection against this method, that some others
promise, what is nearer to the extent of our wishes: since
this, if it will not teach us all we could desire to be informed
of, will however give us some true light into nature; which no
other can do. Nor has the philosopher any reason to think
his labour lost, when he finds himself stopt at the cause first
discovered by him, or at any other more remote cause, short
of the original: for if he has but sufficiently proved any one
cause, he has entered so far into the real constitution of things,
has laid a safe foundation for others to work upon, and
has facilitated their endeavours in the search after yet more
distant causes; and besides, in the mean time he may apply
the knowledge of these intermediate causes to many useful
purposes. Indeed the being able to make practical deductions
from natural causes, constitutes the great distinction
between the true philosophy and the false. Causes assumed
upon conjecture, must be so loose and undefined,
that nothing particular can be collected from them. But those
causes, which are brought to light by a strict examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of things, will be more distinct. Hence it appears to have
been no unuseful discovery, that the ascent of water in pumps
is owing to the pressure of the air by its weight or spring;
though the causes, which make the air gravitate, and render
it elastic, be unknown: for notwithstanding we are ignorant
of the original, whence these powers of the air are derived;
yet we may receive much advantage from the bare
knowledge of these powers. If we are but certain of the degree
of force, wherewith they act, we shall know the extent of
what is to be expected from them; we shall know the greatest
height, to which it is possible by pumps to raise water; and
shall thereby be prevented from making any useless efforts
towards improving these instruments beyond the limits prescribed
to them by nature; whereas without so much knowledge
as this, we might probably have wasted in attempts of
this kind much time and labour. How long did philosophers
busy themselves to no purpose in endeavouring to perfect
telescopes, by forming the glasses into some new figure; till
Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> demonstrated, that the effects of telescopes
were limited from another cause, than was supposed;
which no alteration in the figure of the glasses could remedy?
What method Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> himself has found for
the improvement of telescopes shall be explained hereafter<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.
But at present I shall proceed to illustrate, by some farther instances,
this distinguishing character of the true philosophy, which
we have now under consideration. It was no trifling discovery,
that the contraction of the muscles of animals puts their
limbs in motion, though the original cause of that contraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
remains a secret, and perhaps may always do so; for the
knowledge of thus much only has given rise to many speculations
upon the force and artificial disposition of the muscles,
and has opened no narrow prospect into the animal fabrick.
The finding out, that the nerves are great agents in this action,
leads us yet nearer to the original cause, and yields us a
wider view of the subject. And each of these steps affords us
assistance towards restoring this animal motion, when impaired
in our selves, by pointing out the seats of the injuries, to
which it is obnoxious. To neglect all this, because we can
hitherto advance no farther, is plainly ridiculous. It is
confessed by all, that <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Galileo</em></span> greatly improved philosophy,
by shewing, as we shall relate hereafter, that the power
in bodies, which we call gravity, occasions them to move
downwards with a velocity equably accelerated<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>; and that
when any body is thrown forwards, the same power obliges it
to describe in its motion that line, which is called by geometers
a parabola<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>: yet we are ignorant of the cause, which makes
bodies gravitate. But although we are unacquainted with
the spring, whence this power in nature is derived, nevertheless
we can estimate its effects. When a body falls perpendicularly,
it is known, how long time it takes in descending from
any height whatever: and if it be thrown forwards, we know
the real path, which it describes; we can determine in what
direction, and with what degree of swiftness it must be projected,
in order to its striking against any object desired; and
we can also ascertain the very force, wherewith it will strike.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> has farther taught, that this power of
gravitation extends up to the moon, and causes that planet to
gravitate as much towards the earth, as any of the bodies, which
are familiar to us, would, if placed at the same distance<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>:
he has proved likewise, that all the planets gravitate towards
the sun, and towards one another; and that their respective
motions follow from this gravitation. All this he has demonstrated
upon indisputable geometrical principles, which cannot
be rendered precarious for want of knowing what it is, which
causes these bodies thus mutually to gravitate: any more than
we can doubt of the propensity in all the bodies about us, to
descend towards the earth; or can call in question the forementioned
propositions of <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Galileo</em></span>, which are built upon
that principle. And as <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Galileo</em></span> has shewn more fully,
than was known before, what effects were produced in the
motion of bodies by their gravitation towards the earth; so
Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span>, by this his invention, has much advanced
our knowledge in the celestial motions. By discovering
that the moon gravitates towards the sun, as well as towards
the earth; he has laid open those intricacies in the moon’s
motion, which no astronomer, from observations only, could
ever find out<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>: and one kind of heavenly bodies, the comets,
have their motion now clearly ascertained; whereof we had
before no true knowledge at all<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Doubtless</span> it might be expected, that such surprizing
success should have silenced, at once, every cavil. But we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
have seen the contrary. For because this philosophy professes
modestly to keep within the extent of our faculties, and is
ready to confess its imperfections, rather than to make any
fruitless attempts to conceal them, by seeking to cover the defects
in our knowledge with the vain ostentation of rash and
groundless conjectures; hence has been taken an occasion to
insinuate that we are led to miraculous causes, and the occult
qualities of the schools.</p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> the first of these accusations is very extraordinary.
If by calling these causes miraculous nothing more is
meant than only, that they often appear to us wonderful and
surprizing, it is not easy to see what difficulty can be raised
from thence; for the works of nature discover every where
such proofs of the unbounded power, and the consummate
wisdom of their author, that the more they are known, the
more they will excite our admiration: and it is too manifest
to be insisted on, that the common sense of the word miraculous
can have no place here, when it implies what is above
the ordinary course of things. The other imputation, that
these causes are occult upon the account of our not perceiving
what produces them, contains in it great ambiguity. That
something relating to them lies hid, the followers of this
philosophy are ready to acknowledge, nay desire it should
be carefully remarked, as pointing out proper subjects for future
inquiry. But this is very different from the proceeding
of the schoolmen in the causes called by them occult. For
as their occult qualities were understood to operate in a manner
occult, and not apprehended by us; so they were obtruded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
upon us for such original and essential properties in bodies,
as made it vain to seek any farther cause; and a greater
power was attributed to them, than any natural appearances
authorized. For instance, the rise of water in pumps was ascribed
to a certain abhorrence of a vacuum, which they thought
fit to assign to nature. And this was so far a true observation,
that the water does move, contrary to its usual course, into
the space, which otherwise would be left void of any sensible
matter; and, that the procuring such a vacuity was the apparent
cause of the water’s ascent. But while we were not in
the least informed how this power, called an abhorrence of a
vacuum, produced the visible effects; instead of making any
advancement in the knowledge of nature, we only gave
an artificial name to one of her operations: and when the
speculation was pushed so beyond what any appearances required,
as to have it concluded, that this abhorrence of a vacuum
was a power inherent in all matter, and so unlimited as
to render it impossible for a vacuum to exist at all; it then
became a much greater absurdity, in being made the foundation
of a most ridiculous manner of reasoning; as at length
evidently appeared, when it came to be discovered, that this
rise of the water followed only from the pressure of the air,
and extended it self no farther, than the power of that cause.
The scholastic stile in discoursing of these occult qualities,
as if they were essential differences in the very substances,
of which bodies consisted, was certainly very absurd; by
reason it tended to discourage all farther inquiry. But no
such ill consequences can follow from the considering of
any natural causes, which confessedly are not traced up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
their first original. How shall we ever come to the knowledge
of the several original causes of things, otherwise than
by storing up all intermediate causes which we can discover?
Are all the original and essential properties of matter so very
obvious, that none of them can escape our first view? This is
not probable. It is much more likely, that, if some of the
essential properties are discovered by our first observations, a
stricter examination should bring more to light.</p>


<p>18. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> in order to clear up this point concerning the
essential properties of matter, let us consider the subject a little
distinctly. We are to conceive, that the matter, out of
which the universe of things is formed, is furnished with certain
qualities and powers, whereby it is rendered fit to answer
the purposes, for which it was created. But every property,
of which any particle of this matter is in it self possessed, and
which is not barely the consequence of the union of this particle
with other portions of matter, we may call an essential property:
whereas all other qualities or attributes belonging to
bodies, which depend on their particular frame and composition,
are not essential to the matter, whereof such bodies are
made; because the matter of these bodies will be deprived
of those qualities, only by the dissolution of the body, without
working any change in the original constitution of one
single particle of this mass of matter. Extension we apprehend
to be one of these essential properties, and impenetrability
another. These two belong universally to all matter; and
are the principal ingredients in the idea, which this word
matter usually excites in the mind. Yet as the idea, marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
by this name, is not purely the creature of our own understandings,
but is taken for the representation of a certain
substance without us; if we should discover, that every part
of the substance, in which we find these two properties,
should likewise be endowed universally with any other essential
qualities; all these, from the time they come to our notice,
must be united under our general idea of matter. How
many such properties there are actually in all matter we know
not; those, of which we are at present apprized, have been
found out only by our observations on things; how many
more a farther search may bring to light, no one can say;
nor are we certain, that we are provided with sufficient methods
of perception to discern them all. Therefore, since we
have no other way of making discoveries in nature, but by
gradual inquiries into the properties of bodies; our first step
must be to admit without distinction all the properties, which
we observe; and afterwards we must endeavour, as far as we
are able, to distinguish between the qualities, wherewith the
very substances themselves are indued, and those appearances,
which result from the structure only of compound bodies.
Some of the properties, which we observe in things, are the
attributes of particular bodies only; others universally belong
to all, that fall under our notice. Whether some of the
qualities and powers of particular bodies, be derived from different
kinds of matter entring their composition, cannot, in
the present imperfect state of our knowledge, absolutely be
decided; though we have not yet any reason to conclude,
but that all the bodies, with which we converse, are framed
out of the very same kind of matter, and that their distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
qualities are occasioned only by their structure; through the variety
whereof the general powers of matter are caused to produce
different effects. On the other hand, we should not hastily
conclude, that whatever is found to appertain to all matter,
which falls under our examination, must for that reason
only be an essential property thereof, and not be derived from
some unseen disposition in the frame of nature. Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac
Newton</em></span> has found reason to conclude, that gravity is a property
universally belonging to all the perceptible bodies in the
universe, and to every particle of matter, whereof they are
composed. But yet he no where asserts this property to be
essential to matter. And he was so far from having any design
of establishing it as such, that, on the contrary, he has
given some hints worthy of himself at a cause for it<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>; and expresly
says, that he proposed those hints to shew, that he had
no such intention<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> appears from hence, that it is not easy to determine,
what properties of bodies are essentially inherent in the
matter, out of which they are made, and what depend upon
their frame and composition. But certainly whatever properties
are found to belong either to any particular systems of
matter, or universally to all, must be considered in philosophy;
because philosophy will be otherwise imperfect. Whether
those properties can be deduced from some other appertaining
to matter, either among those, which are already known,
or among such as can be discovered by us, is afterwards to be
sought for the farther improvement of our knowledge. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
inquiry cannot properly have place in the deliberation about admitting
any property of matter or bodies into philosophy; for
that purpose it is only to be considered, whether the existence
of such a property has been justly proved or not. Therefore
to decide what causes of things are rightly received into natural
philosophy, requires only a distinct and clear conception
of what kind of reasoning is to be allowed of as convincing,
when we argue upon the works of nature.</p>

<p>20. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> proofs in natural philosophy cannot be so absolutely
conclusive, as in the mathematics. For the subjects of
that science are purely the ideas of our own minds. They
may be represented to our senses by material objects, but they
are themselves the arbitrary productions of our own thoughts;
so that as the mind can have a full and adequate knowledge
of its own ideas, the reasoning in geometry can be rendered
perfect. But in natural knowledge the subject of our contemplation
is without us, and not so compleatly to be known:
therefore our method of arguing must fall a little short of absolute
perfection. It is only here required to steer a just course
between the conjectural method of proceeding, against which
I have so largely spoke; and demanding so rigorous a proof, as
will reduce all philosophy to mere scepticism, and exclude all
prospect of making any progress in the knowledge of nature.</p>

<p>21. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> concessions, which are to be allowed in this science,
are by Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> included under a very
few simple precepts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> first is, that more causes are not to be received
into philosophy, than are sufficient to explain the appearances
of nature. That this rule is approved of unanimously, is evident
from those expressions so frequent among all philosophers,
that nature does nothing in vain; and that a variety
of means, where fewer would suffice, is needless. And
certainly there is the highest reason for complying with this
rule. For should we indulge the liberty of multiplying,
without necessity, the causes of things, it would reduce
all philosophy to mere uncertainty; since the only proof,
which we can have, of the existence of a cause, is the necessity
of it for producing known effects. Therefore where
one cause is sufficient, if there really should in nature be
two, which is in the last degree improbable, we can have no
possible means of knowing it, and consequently ought not to
take the liberty of imagining, that there are more than one.</p>

<p>23. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> second precept is the direct consequence of the
first, that to like effects are to be ascribed the same causes.
For instance, that respiration in men and in brutes is brought
about by the same means; that bodies descend to the earth
here in <span class="smcap">Europe</span>, and in <span class="smcap">America</span> from the same principle;
that the light of a culinary fire, and of the sun have the same
manner of production; that the reflection of light is effected in
the earth, and in the planets by the same power; and the like.</p>

<p>24. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> third of these precepts has equally evident reason
for it. It is only, that those qualities, which in the same
body can neither be lessened nor increased, and which belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to all bodies that are in our power to make trial upon, ought
to be accounted the universal properties of all bodies whatever.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> this precept is founded that method of arguing by
induction, without which no progress could be made in natural
philosophy.  For as the qualities of bodies become
known to us by experiments only; we have no other way of
finding the properties of such bodies, as are out of our reach
to experiment upon, but by drawing conclusions from those
which fall under our examination. The only caution here
required is, that the observations and experiments, we argue
upon, be numerous enough, and that due regard be paid to
all objections, that occur, as the Lord <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> very judiciously
directs<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. And this admonition is sufficiently complied
with, when by virtue of this rule we ascribe impenetrability
and extension to all bodies, though we have no sensible
experiment, that affords a direct proof of any of the celestial
bodies being impenetrable; nor that the fixed stars
are so much as extended.  For the more perfect our instruments
are, whereby we attempt to find their visible magnitude,
the less they appear; insomuch that all the sensible
magnitude, which we observe in them, seems only to be an
optical deception by the scattering of their light. However,
I suppose no one will imagine they are without any magnitude,
though their immense distance makes it undiscernable
by us. After the same manner, if it can be proved, that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
bodies here gravitate towards the earth, in proportion to the
quantity of solid matter in each; and that the moon gravitates
to the earth likewise, in proportion to the quantity of matter
in it; and that the sea gravitates towards the moon, and all
the planets towards each other; and that the very comets have
the same gravitating faculty; we shall have as great reason to
conclude by this rule, that all bodies gravitate towards each
other. For indeed this rule will more strongly hold in this
case, than in that of the impenetrability of bodies; because
there will more instances be had of bodies gravitating, than
of their being impenetrable.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> is that method of induction, whereon all philosophy
is founded; which our author farther inforces by
this additional precept, that whatever is collected from this
induction, ought to be received, notwithstanding any conjectural
hypothesis to the contrary, till such times as it shall be
contradicted or limited by farther observations on nature.</p>

</div>
<p class="cap13">HAVING thus explained Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac
Newton</span>’s</em> method of reasoning in
philosophy, I shall now proceed to
my intended account of his discoveries.
These are contained in two treatises.
In one of them, the <span class="smcap">Mathematical
principles of natural philosophy</span>,
his chief design is to shew by what laws the heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
motions are regulated; in the other, his <span class="smcap">Optics</span>, he discourses
of the nature of light and colours, and of the action between
light and bodies. This second treatise is wholly confined to
the subject of light: except some conjectures proposed at the
end concerning other parts of nature, which lie hitherto more
concealed. In the other treatise our author was obliged to
smooth the way to his principal intention, by explaining many
things of a more general nature: for even some of the most
simple properties of matter were scarce well established at that
time. We may therefore reduce Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span>’s doctrine
under three general heads; and I shall accordingly divide
my account into three books. In the first I shall speak
of what he has delivered concerning the motion of bodies,
without regard to any particular system of matter; in the second
I shall treat of the heavenly motions; and the third
shall be employed upon light.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the first part of my design, we must begin with an
account of the general laws of motion.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> laws are some universal affections and properties
of matter drawn from experience, which are made use
of as axioms and evident principles in all our arguings upon the
motion of bodies. For as it is the custom of geometers to
assume in their demonstrations some propositions, without
exhibiting the proof of them; so in philosophy, all our reasoning
must be built upon some properties of matter, first admitted
as principles whereon to argue. In geometry these axioms
are thus assumed, on account of their being so evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
as to make any proof in form needless. But in philosophy
no properties of bodies can be in this manner received for self-evident;
since it has been observed above, that we can conclude
nothing concerning matter by any reasonings upon its
nature and essence, but that we owe all the knowledge, we
have thereof, to experience. Yet when our observations on
matter have inform’d us of some of its properties, we may securely
reason upon them in our farther inquiries into nature.
And these laws of motion, of which I am here to speak, are
found so universally to belong to bodies, that there is no motion
known, which is not regulated by them. These are by
Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> reduced to three<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c29a" id="c29a">4.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> first law is, that all bodies have such an indifference
to rest, or motion, that if once at rest they remain so, till disturbed
by some power acting upon them: but if once put
in motion, they persist in it; continuing to move right forwards
perpetually, after the power, which gave the motion,
is removed; and also preserving the same degree of velocity
or quickness, as was first communicated, not stopping or remitting
their course, till interrupted or otherwise disturbed by
some new power impressed.</p>

<p><a name="c29b" id="c29b">5.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> second law of motion is, that the alteration of the
state of any body, whether from rest to motion, or from motion
to rest, or from one degree of motion to another, is always
proportional to the force impressed. A body at rest, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
acted upon by any power, yields to that power, moving in
the same line, in which the power applied is directed; and
moves with a less or greater degree of velocity, according to
the degree of the power; so that twice the power shall communicate
a double velocity, and three times the power a
threefold velocity. If the body be moving, and the power
impressed act upon the body in the direction of its motion,
the body shall receive an addition to its motion, as great as
the motion, into which that power would have put it from a
state of rest; but if the power impressed upon a moving body
act directly opposite to its former motion, that power shall
then take away from the body’s motion, as much as in the other
case it would have added to it. Lastly, if the power be
impressed obliquely, there will arise an oblique motion differing
more or less from the former direction, according as
the new impression is greater or less. For example, if the body
A (in fig. 1.) be moving in the direction A&nbsp;B, and when it is
at the point A, a power be impressed upon it in the direction
A&nbsp;C, the body shall from henceforth neither move in its first
direction A&nbsp;B, nor in the direction of the adventitious power,
but shall take a course as A&nbsp;D between them: and if the
power last impressed be just equal to that, which first gave
to the body its motion; the line A&nbsp;D shall pass in the middle
between A&nbsp;B and A&nbsp;C, dividing the angle under B&nbsp;A&nbsp;C into
two equal parts; but if the power last impressed be greater
than the first, the line A&nbsp;D shall incline most to A&nbsp;C; whereas
if the last impression be less than the first, the line A&nbsp;D shall
incline most to A&nbsp;B. To be more particular, the situation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the line A&nbsp;D is always to be determined after this manner.
Let A&nbsp;E be the space, which the body would have moved
through in the line A&nbsp;B during any certain portion of time;
provided that body, when at A, had received no second impulse.
Suppose likewise, that A&nbsp;F is the part of the line A&nbsp;C,
through which the body would have moved during an equal
portion of time, if it had been at rest in A, when it received
the impulse in the direction A&nbsp;C: then if from E be drawn
a line parallel to, or equidistant from A&nbsp;C, and from F another
line parallel to A&nbsp;B, those two lines will meet in the
line A&nbsp;D.</p>

<p><a name="c31" id="c31">6.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> third and last of these laws of motion is, that
when any body acts upon another, the action of that body
upon the other is equalled by the contrary reaction of that
other body upon the first.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> laws of motion are abundantly confirmed by
this, that all the deductions made from them, in relation to
the motion of bodies, how complicated soever, are found to
agree perfectly with observation. This shall be shewn more
at large in the next chapter. But before we proceed to so
diffusive a proof; I chuse here to point out those appearances
of bodies, whereby the laws of motion are first suggested
to us.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Daily</span> observation makes it appear to us, that any
body, which we once see at rest, never puts it self into fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
motion; but continues always in the same place, till removed
by some power applied to it.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Again</span>, whenever a body is once in motion, it continues
in that motion some time after the moving power has quitted
it, and it is left to it self. Now if the body continue to move
but a single moment, after the moving power has left it, there
can no reason be assigned, why it should ever stop without
some external force. For it is plain, that this continuance of
the motion is caused only by the body’s having already moved,
the sole operation of the power upon the body being the
putting it in motion; therefore that motion continued will equally
be the cause of its farther motion, and so on without
end. The only doubt that can remain, is, whether this motion
communicated continues intire, after the power, that caused
it, ceases to act; or whether it does not gradually languish and
decrease. And this suspicion cannot be removed by a transient
and slight observation on bodies, but will be fully cleared
up by those more accurate proofs of the laws of motion,
which are to be considered in the next chapter.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Lastly</span>, bodies in motion appear to affect a straight
course without any deviation, unless when disturbed by some
adventitious power acting upon them. If a body be thrown
perpendicularly upwards or downwards, it appears to continue
in the same straight line during the whole time of its motion.
If a body be thrown in any other direction, it is found to deviate
from the line, in which it began to move, more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
more continually towards the earth, whither it is directed
by its weight: but since, when the weight of a body does
not alter the direction of its motion, it always moves in
a straight line, without doubt in this other case the body’s,
declining from its first course is no more, than what is caused
by its weight alone. As this appears at first sight to be
unquestionable, so we shall have a very distinct proof thereof
in the next chapter, where the oblique motion of bodies will
be particularly considered.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> we see how the first of the laws of motion
agrees with what appears to us in moving bodies. But
here occurs this farther consideration, that the real and absolute
motion of any body is not visible to us: for we
are our selves also in constant motion along with the
earth whereon we dwell; insomuch that we perceive bodies
to move so far only, as their motion is different from
our own. When a body appears to us to lie at rest, in
reality it only continues the motion, it has received, without
putting forth any power to change that motion. If we
throw a body in the course or direction, wherein we are
carried our selves; so much motion as we seem to have
given to the body, so much we have truly added to the
motion, it had, while it appeared to us to be at rest. But
if we impel a body the contrary way, although the body
appears to us to have received by such an impulse as much
motion, as when impelled the other way; yet in this case we
have taken from the body so much real motion, as we seem
to have given it. Thus the motion, which we see in bodies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
is not their real motion, but only relative with respect to us;
and the forementioned observations only shew us, that this
first law of motion has place in this relative or apparent
motion. However, though we cannot make any observation
immediately on the absolute motion of bodies, yet by
reasoning upon what we observe in visible motion, we can
discover the properties and effects of real motion.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap gesperrt">With</span> regard to this first law of motion, which is
now under consideration, we may from the foregoing observations
most truly collect, that bodies are disposed to continue
in the absolute motion, which they have once received,
without increasing or diminishing their velocity. When a
body appears to us to lie at rest, it really preserves without
change the motion, which it has in common with our selves:
and when we put it into visible motion, and we see it continue
that motion; this proves, that the body retains that degree
of its absolute motion, into which it is put by our acting
upon it: if we give it such an apparent motion, which adds
to its real motion, it preserves that addition; and if our acting
on the body takes off from its real motion, it continues
afterwards to move with no more real motion, than we have
left it.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Again</span>, we do not observe in bodies any disposition or
power within themselves to change the direction of their motion;
and if they had any such power, it would easily be discovered.
For suppose a body by the structure or disposition
of its parts, or by any other circumstance in its make, was indued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with a power of moving it self; this self-moving principle,
which should be thus inherent in the body, and not
depend on any thing external, must change the direction
wherein it would act, as often as the position of the body
was changed: so that for instance, if a body was lying before
me in such a position, that the direction, wherein this
principle disposes the body to move, was pointed directly from
me; if I then gradually turned the body about, the direction
of this self-moving principle would no longer be pointed directly
from me, but would turn about along with the body.
Now if any body, which appears to us at rest, were furnished
with any such self-moving principle; from the body’s appearing
without motion we must conclude, that this self-moving
principle lies directed the same way as the earth is carrying
the body; and such a body might immediately be put
into visible motion only by turning it about in any degree,
that this self-moving principle might receive a different direction.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> these considerations it very plainly follows,
that if a body were once absolutely at rest; not being furnished
with any principle, whereby it could put it self into
motion, it must for ever continue in the same place, till acted
upon by something external: and also that when a body is put
into motion, it has no power within it self to make any
change in the direction of that motion; and consequently
that the body must move on straight forward without declining
any way whatever. But it has before been shewn, that
bodies do not appear to have in themselves any power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
change the velocity of their motion: therefore this first law
of motion has been illustrated and confirmed, as much as can
be from the transient observations, which have here been discoursed
upon; and in the next chapter all this will be farther
established by more correct observations.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> I shall now pass to the second law of motion;
wherein, when it is asserted, that the velocity, with which
any body is moved by the action of a power upon it, is proportional
to that power; the degree of power is supposed to
be measured by the greatness of the body, which it can move
with a given celerity. So that the sense of this law is, that
if any body were put into motion with that degree of swiftness,
as to pass in one hour the length of a thousand yards;
the power, which would give the same degree of velocity to
a body twice as great, would give this lesser body twice the
velocity, causing it to describe in the same space of an hour
two thousand yards. But by a body twice as great as another,
I do not here mean simply of twice the bulk, but one that
contains a double quantity of solid matter.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Why</span> the power, which can move a body twice as great
as another with the same degree of velocity, should be called
twice as great as the power, which can give the lesser body
the same velocity, is evident. For if we should suppose the
greater body to be divided into two equal parts, each equal
to the lesser body, each of these halves will require the same
degree of power to move them with the velocity of the lesser
body, as the lesser body it self requires; and therefore both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
those halves, or the whole greater body, will require the
moving power to be doubled.</p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap gesperrt">That</span> the moving power being in this sense doubled,
should just double likewise the velocity of the same body,
seems near as evident, if we consider, that the effect of the
power applied must needs be the same, whether that power
be applied to the body at once, or in parts. Suppose then the
double power not applied to the body at once, but half of it
first, and afterwards the other half; it is not conceivable for
what reason the half last applied should come to have a different
effect upon the body, from that which is applied first;
as it must have, if the velocity of the body was not just doubled
by the application of it. So far as experience can determine,
we see nothing to favour such a supposition. We cannot
indeed (by reason of the constant motion of the earth)
make trial upon any body perfectly at rest, whereby to see
whether a power applied in that case would have a different
effect, from what it has, when the body is already moving;
but we find no alteration in the effect of the same power on
account of any difference there may be in the motion of the
body, when the power is applied. The earth does not always
carry bodies with the same degree of velocity; yet we
find the visible effects of any power applied to the same body
to be, at all times the very same: and a bale of goods, or
other moveable body lying in a ship is as easily removed
from place to place, while the ship is under sail, if its motion
be steady, as when it is fixed at anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> this experience is alone sufficient to shew to us
the whole of this law of motion.</p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Since</span> we find, that the same power will always produce
the same change in the motion of any body, whether
that body were before moving with a swifter or slower motion;
the change wrought in the motion of a body depends
only on the power applied to it, without any regard to the
body’s former motion: and therefore the degree of motion,
which the body already possesses, having no influence on the
power applied to disturb its operation, the effects of the
same power will not only be the same in all degrees of motion
of the body; but we have likewise no reason to doubt,
but that a body perfectly at rest would receive from any power
as much motion, as would be equivalent to the effect of the
same power applied to that body already in motion.</p>

<p>20. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Again</span>, suppose a body being at rest, any number of
equal powers should be successively applied to it; pushing it
forward from time to time in the same course or direction.
Upon the application of the first power the body would begin
to move; when the second power was applied, it appears from
what has been said, that the motion of the body would become
double; the third power would treble the motion of the
body; and so on, till after the operation of the last power the
motion of the body would be as many times the motion,
which the first power gave it, as there are powers in number.
and the effect of this number of powers will be always the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
same, without any regard to the space of time taken up in
applying them: so that greater or lesser intervals between
the application of each of these powers will produce no difference
at all in their effects. Since therefore the distance of
time between the action of each power is of no consequence;
without doubt the effect will still be the same, though the
powers should all be applied at the very same instant; or although
a single power should be applied equal in strength to
the collective force of all these powers. Hence it plainly follows,
that the degree of motion, into which any body will
be put out of a state of rest by any power, will be proportional
to that power. A double power will give twice the velocity,
a treble power three times the velocity, and so on. The
foregoing reasoning will equally take place, though the body
were not supposed to be at rest, when the powers began to
be applied to it; provided the direction, in which the powers
were applied, either conspired with the action of the body, or
was directly opposite to it. Therefore if any power be applied
to a moving body, and act upon the body either in
the direction wherewith the body moves, so as to accelerate
the body; or if it act directly opposite to the motion of the
body, so as to retard it: in both these cases the change of
motion will be proportional to the power applied; nay, the
augmentation of the motion in one case, and the diminution
thereof in the other, will be equal to that degree of
motion, into which the same power would put the body, had
it been at rest, when the power was applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>21. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Farther</span>, a power may be so applied to a moving
body, as to act obliquely to the motion of the body. And
the effects of such an oblique motion may be deduced from
this observation; that as all bodies are continually moving along
with the earth, we see that the visible effects of the same
power are always the same, in whatever direction the power
acts: and therefore the visible effects of any power upon a
body, which seems only to be at rest, is always to appearance
the same as the real effect would be upon a body truly at rest.
Now suppose a body were moving along the line A&nbsp;B (in
fig. 2.) and the eye accompanied it with an equal motion in
the line C&nbsp;D equidistant from A&nbsp;B; so that when the body is
at A, the eye shall be at C, and when the body is advanced to
E in the line A&nbsp;B, the eye shall be advanced to F in the line
C&nbsp;D, the distances A&nbsp;E and C&nbsp;F being equal. It is evident,
that here the body will appear to the eye to be at rest; and
the line F&nbsp;E&nbsp;G drawn from the eye through the body shall seem
to the eye to be immoveable; though as the body and eye
move forward together, this line shall really also move; so
that when the body shall be advanced to H and the eye to K,
the line F&nbsp;E&nbsp;G shall be transferred into the situation K&nbsp;H&nbsp;L,
this line K&nbsp;H&nbsp;L being equidistant from F&nbsp;E&nbsp;G. Now if the body
when at E were to receive an impulse in the direction of
the line F&nbsp;E&nbsp;G; while the eye is moving on from F to K and
carrying along with it the line F&nbsp;E&nbsp;G, the body will appear to
the eye to move along this line F&nbsp;E&nbsp;G: for this is what has just
now been said; that while bodies are moving along with the
earth, and the spectator’s eye partakes of the same motion,
the effect of any power upon the body will appear to be what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
it would really have been, had the body been truly at rest,
when the power was applied. From hence it follows, that
when the eye is advanced to K, the body will appear somewhere
in the line K&nbsp;H&nbsp;L. Suppose it appear in M; then it is
manifest, from what has been premised at the beginning of
this paragraph, that the distance H&nbsp;M is equal to what the
body would have run upon the line E&nbsp;G, during the time,
wherein the eye has passed from F to K, provided that the body
had been at rest, when acted upon in E. If it be farther
asked, after what manner the body has moved from E to M?
I answer, through a straight line; for it has been shewn above
in the explication of the first law of motion, that a moving
body, from the time it is left to it self, will proceed on in
one continued straight line.</p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> E&nbsp;N be taken equal to H&nbsp;M and N&nbsp;M be drawn;
since H&nbsp;M is equidistant from E&nbsp;N, N&nbsp;M will be equidistant
from E&nbsp;H. Therefore the effect of any power upon a moving
body, when that power acts obliquely to the motion of the
body, is to be determined in this manner. Suppose the body
is moving along the straight line A&nbsp;E&nbsp;B, if when the body is
come to E, a power gives it an impulse in the direction of the
line E&nbsp;G, to find what course the body will afterwards take
we must proceed thus. Take in E&nbsp;B any length E&nbsp;H, and in
E&nbsp;G take such a length E&nbsp;N, that if the body had been at rest
in E, the power applied to it would have caused it to move
over E&nbsp;N in the same space of time, as it would have employed
in passing over E&nbsp;H, if the power had not acted at all upon it.
Then draw H&nbsp;L equidistant from E&nbsp;G, and N&nbsp;M equidistant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
from E&nbsp;B. After this, if a line be drawn from E to the
point M, where these two lines meet, the line E&nbsp;M will be the
course into which the body will be put by the action of the
power upon it at E.</p>

<p>23. <span class="smcap gesperrt">A mathematical</span> reader would here expect in
some particulars more regular demonstrations; but as I do
not at present address my self to such, so I hope, what I have
now written will render my meaning evident enough to those,
who are unacquainted with that kind of reasoning.</p>

<p>24. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> as we have been shewing, that some actual
force is necessary either to put bodies out of a state of rest into
motion, or to change the motion, which they have once
received; it is proper here to observe, that this quality in bodies,
whereby they preserve their present state, with regard
to motion or rest, till some active force disturb them, is called
the <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">vis inertiae</em></span> of matter: and by this property, matter,
sluggish and unactive of it self, retains all the power impressed
upon it, and cannot be made to cease from action, but
by the opposition of as great a power, as that which first moved
it. By the degree of this <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">vis inertiae</em></span>, or power of inactivity,
as we shall henceforth call it, we primarily judge of
the quantity of solid matter in each body; for as this quality is
inherent in all the bodies, upon which we can make any trial,
we conclude it to be a property essential to all matter; and
as we yet know no reason to suppose, that bodies are composed
of different kinds of matter, we rather presume, that
the matter of all bodies is the same; and that the degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
this power of inactivity is in every body proportional to the
quantity of the solid matter in it. But although we have no
absolute proof, that all the matter in the universe is uniform,
and possesses this power of inactivity in the same degree; yet
we can with certainty compare together the different degrees
of this power of inactivity in different bodies. Particularly
this power is proportional to the weight of bodies, as Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac
Newton</span></em> has demonstrated<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. However, notwithstanding
that this power of inactivity in any body can be more certainly
known, than the quantity of solid matter in it; yet since
there is no reason to suspect that one is not proportional to the
other, we shall hereafter speak without hesitation of the quantity
of matter in bodies, as the measure of the degree of their
power of inactivity.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> being established, we may now compare the
effects of the same power upon different bodies, as hitherto
we have shewn the effects of different powers upon the
same body. And here if we limit the word motion to the
peculiar sense given to it in philosophy, we may comprehend
all that is to be said upon this head under one short precept;
that the same power, to whatever body it is applied, will always
produce the same degree of motion. But here motion
does not signify the degree of celerity or velocity with which
a body moves, in which sense only we have hitherto used it;
but it is made use of particularly in philosophy to signify the
force with which a body moves: as if two bodies A and B being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in motion, twice the force would be required to stop A as
to stop B, the motion of A would be esteemed double the
motion of B. In moving bodies, these two things are carefully
to be distinguished; their velocity or celerity, which is
measured by the space they pass through during any determinate
portion of time; and the quantity of their motion, or
the force, with which they will press against any resistance.
Which force, when different bodies move with the same velocity,
is proportional to the quantity of solid matter in the
bodies; but if the bodies are equal, this force is proportional
to their respective velocities, and in other cases it is proportional
both to the quantity of solid matter in the body, and
also to its velocity. To instance in two bodies A and B: if A be
twice as great as B, and they have both the same velocity, the
motion of A shall be double the motion of B; and if the bodies
be equal, and the velocity of A be twice that of B, the
motion of A shall likewise be double that of B; but if A be
twice as large as B, and move twice as swift, the motion of A
will be four times the motion of B; and lastly, if A be twice
as large as B, and move but half as fast, the degree of their
motion shall be the same.</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> is the particular sense given to the word motion
by philosophers, and in this sense of the word the same power
always produces the same quantity or degree of motion. If
the same power act upon two bodies A and B, the velocities,
it shall give to each of them, shall be so adjusted to the respective
bodies, that the same degree of motion shall be produced
in each. If A be twice as great as B, its velocity shall be half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that of B; if A has three times as much solid matter as B, the
velocity of A shall be one third of the velocity of B; and generally
the velocity given to A shall bear the same proportion
to the velocity given to B, as the quantity of solid matter contained
in the body B bears to the quantity of solid matter contained
in A.</p>

<p>27. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> reason of all this is evident from what has gone
before. If a power were applied to B, which should bear
the same proportion to the power applied to A, as the body B
bears to A, the bodies B and A would both receive the same
velocity; and the velocity, which B will receive from this
power, will bear the same proportion to the velocity, which
it would receive from the action of the power applied to A,
as the former of these powers bears to the latter: that is,
the velocity, which A receives from the power applied to it,
will bear to the velocity, which B would receive from
the same power, the same proportion as the body B bears
to A.</p>

<p>28. <span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> hence we may now pass to the third law of
motion, where this distinction between the velocity of a body
and its whole motion is farther necessary to be regarded, as
shall immediately be shewn; after having first illustrated the
meaning of this law by a familiar instance. If a stone or other
load be drawn by a horse; the load re-acts upon the horse,
as much as the horse acts upon the load; for the harness,
which is strained between them, presses against the horse as
much as against the load; and the progressive motion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
horse forward is hindred as much by the load, as the motion
of the load is promoted by the endeavour of the horse: that
is, if the horse put forth the same strength, when loosened
from the load, he would move himself forwards with greater
swiftness in proportion to the difference between the weight
of his own body and the weight of himself and load together.</p>

<p>29. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> instance will afford some general notion of the
meaning of this law. But to proceed to a more philosophical
explication: if a body in motion strike against another at
rest, let the body striking be ever so small, yet shall it communicate
some degree of motion to the body it strikes against,
though the less that body be in comparison of that it impinges
upon, and the less the velocity is, with which it moves,
the smaller will be the motion communicated. But whatever
degree of motion it gives to the resting body, the same it
shall lose it self. This is the necessary consequence of the
forementioned power of inactivity in matter. For suppose
the two bodies equal, it is evident from the time they meet,
both the bodies are to be moved by the single motion of the
first; therefore the body in motion by means of its power of
inactivity retaining the motion first given it, strikes upon the
other with the same force, wherewith it was acted upon it
self: but now both the bodies being to be moved by that
force, which before moved one only, the ensuing velocity
will be the same, as if the power, which was applied to one
of the bodies, and put it into motion, had been applied to
both; whence it appears, that they will proceed forwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with half the velocity, which the body first in motion had:
that is, the body first moved will have lost half its motion,
and the other will have gained exactly as much. This rule
is just, provided the bodies keep contiguous after meeting; as
they would always do, if it were not for a certain cause that
often intervenes, and which must now be explained. Bodies
upon striking against each other, suffer an alteration in their
figure, having their parts pressed inwards by the stroke, which
for the most part recoil again afterwards, the bodies endeavouring
to recover their former shape. This power, whereby
bodies are inabled to regain their first figure, is usually called
their elasticity, and when it acts, it forces the bodies from
each other, and causes them to separate. Now the effect of
this elasticity in the present case is such, that if the bodies are
perfectly elastic, so as to recoil with as great a force as they
are bent with, that they recover their figure in the same space
of time, as has been taken up in the alteration made in it by
their compression together; then this power will separate the
bodies as swiftly, as they before approached, and acting upon
both equally, upon the body first in motion contrary to
the direction in which it moves, and upon the other as much
in the direction of its motion, it will take from the first, and
add to the other equal degrees of velocity: so that the power
being strong enough to separate them with as great a velocity,
as they approached with, the first will be quite stopt, and
that which was at rest, will receive all the motion of the
other. If the bodies are elastic in a less degree, the first will
not lose all its motion, nor will the other acquire the motion
of the first, but fall as much short of it, as the other retains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
For this rule is never deviated from, that though the degree
of elasticity determines how much more than half its velocity
the body first in motion shall lose; yet in every case the
loss in the motion of this body shall be transferred to the other,
that other body always receiving by the stroke as much motion,
as is taken from the first.</p>

<p>30. This is the case of a body striking directly against an
equal body at rest, and the reasoning here used is fully confirmed
by experience. There are many other cases of bodies
impinging against one another: but the mention of these
shall be reserved to the next chapter, where we intend to be
more particular and diffusive in the proof of these laws of motion,
than we have been here.</p>

Farther proofs of the <span class="smcap">Laws of Motion</span>.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap06"><span class="gesperrt">HAVING</span> in the preceding chapter deduced the three
laws of motion, delivered by our great philosopher,
from the most obvious observations, that suggest them to us;
I now intend to give more particular proofs of them, by recounting
some of the discoveries which have been made in
philosophy before Sir Isaac Newton. For as they were
all collected by reasoning upon those laws; so the conformity
of these discoveries to experience makes them so many proofs
of the truth of the principles, from which they were derived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="c49" id="c49"></a>2. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Let</span> us begin with the subject, which concluded the
last chapter. Although the body in motion be not equal to
the body at rest, on which it strikes; yet the motion after
the stroke is to be estimated in the same manner as above.
Let A (in fig. 3.) be a body in motion towards another body
B lying at rest. When A is arrived at B, it cannot proceed
farther without putting B into motion; and what motion it
gives to B, it must lose it self, that the whole degree of motion
of A and B together, if neither of the bodies be elastic,
shall be equal, after the meeting of the bodies, to the single
motion of A before the stroke. Therefore, from what has
been said above, it is manifest, that as soon as the two bodies
are met, they will move on together with a velocity, which
will bear the same proportion to the original velocity of A, as
the body A bears to the sum of both the bodies.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the bodies are elastic, so that they shall separate after
the stroke, A must lose a greater part of its motion, and
the subsequent motion of B will be augmented by this elasticity,
as much as the motion of A is diminished by it. The
elasticity acting equally between both the bodies, it will communicate
to each the same degree of motion; that is, it will
separate the bodies by taking from the body A and adding to
the body B different degrees of velocity, so proportioned to
their respective quantities of matter, that the degree of motion,
wherewith A separates from B, shall be equal to the degree
of motion, wherewith B separates from A. It follows
therefore, that the velocity taken from A by the elasticity
bears to the velocity, which the same elasticity adds to B, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
same proportion, as B bears to A: consequently the velocity,
which the elasticity takes from A, will bear the same proportion
to the whole velocity, wherewith this elasticity causes the
two bodies to separate from each other, as the body B bears to
the sum of the two bodies A and B; and the velocity, which
is added to B by the elasticity, bears to the velocity, wherewith
the bodies separate, the same proportion, as the body A
bears to the sum of the two bodies A and B. Thus is found,
how much the elasticity takes from the velocity of A, and
adds to the velocity of B; provided the degree of elasticity be
known, whereby to determine the whole velocity wherewith
the bodies separate from each other after the stroke<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> this manner is determined in every case the result
of a body in motion striking against another at rest. The
same principles will also determine the effects, when both
bodies are in motion.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Let</span> two equal bodies move against each other with equal
swiftness. Then the force, with which each of them
presses forwards, being equal when they strike; each pressing
in its own direction with the same energy, neither shall
surmount the other, but both be stopt, if they be not elastic:
for if they be elastic, they shall from thence recover new motion,
and recede from each other, as swiftly as they met, if
they be perfectly elastic; but more slowly, if less so. In the
same manner, if two bodies of unequal bigness strike against
each other, and their velocities be so related, that the velocity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the lesser body shall exceed the velocity of the greater in
the same proportion, as the greater body exceeds the lesser (for
instance, if one body contains twice the solid matter as the other,
and moves but half as fast) two such bodies will entirely
suppress each other’s motion, and remain from the time of
their meeting fixed; if, as before, they are not elastic: but,
if they are so in the highest degree, they shall recede again,
each with the same velocity, wherewith they met. For this
elastic power, as in the preceding case, shall renew their motion,
and pressing equally upon both, shall give the same motion
to both; that is, shall cause the velocity, which the lesser
body receives, to bear the same proportion to the velocity,
which the greater receives, as the greater body bears to the
lesser: so that the velocities shall bear the same proportion to
each other after the stroke, as before. Therefore if the bodies,
by being perfectly elastic, have the sum of their velocities
after the stroke equal to the sum of their velocities before the
stroke, each body after the stroke will receive its first velocity.
And the same proportion will hold likewise between the
velocities, wherewith they go off, though they are elastic but
in a less degree; only then the velocity of each will be less in
proportion to the defect of elasticity.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the velocities, wherewith the bodies meet, are not
in the proportion here supposed; but if one of the bodies, as
A, has a swifter velocity in comparison to the velocity of the
other; then the effect of this excess of velocity in the body A
must be joined to the effect now mentioned, after the manner
of this following example. Let A be twice as great as B, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
move with the same swiftness as B. Here A moves with twice
that degree of swiftness, which would answer to the forementioned
proportion. For A being double to B, if it moved
but with half the swiftness, wherewith B advances, it has been
just now shewn, that the two bodies upon meeting would
stop, if they were not elastic; and if they were elastic, that
they would each recoil, so as to cause A to return with half
the velocity, wherewith B would return. But it is evident
from hence, that B by encountring A will annul half its velocity,
if the bodies be not elastic; and the future motion of the
bodies will be the same, as if A had advanced against B at
rest with half the velocity here assigned to it. If the bodies
be elastic, the velocity of A and B after the stroke may be thus
discovered. As the two bodies advance against each other,
the velocity, with which they meet, is made up of the velocities
of both bodies added together. After the stroke their
elasticity will separate them again. The degree of elasticity
will determine what proportion the velocity, wherewith they
separate, must bear to that, wherewith they meet. Divide
this velocity, with which the bodies separate into two parts,
that one of the parts bear to the other the same proportion, as
the body A bears to B; and ascribe the lesser part to the greater
body A, and the greater part of the velocity to the lesser
body B. Then take the part ascribed to A from the common
velocity, which A and B would have had after the stroke, if
they had not been elastic; and add the part ascribed to B to
the same common velocity. By this means the true velocities
of A and B after the stroke will be made known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the bodies are perfectly elastic, the great <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Huygens</em></span>
has laid down this rule for finding their motion after concourse<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.
Any straight line C&nbsp;D (in fig. 4, 5.) being drawn,
let it be divided in E, that C&nbsp;E bear the same proportion to
E&nbsp;D, as the swiftness of A bore to the swiftness of B before the
stroke. Let the same line C&nbsp;D be also divided in F, that C&nbsp;F
bear the same proportion to F&nbsp;D, as the body B bears to the
body A. Then F&nbsp;G being taken equal to F&nbsp;E, if the point G
falls within the line C&nbsp;D, both the bodies shall recoil after the
stroke, and the velocity, wherewith the body A shall return,
will bear the same proportion to the velocity, wherewith B
shall return, as G&nbsp;C bears to G&nbsp;D; but if the point G falls without
the line C&nbsp;D, then the bodies after their concourse shall
both proceed to move the same way, and the velocity of A
shall bear to the velocity of B the same proportion, that G&nbsp;C
bears to G&nbsp;D, as before.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the body B had stood still, and received the impulse
of the other body A upon it; the effect has been already explained
in the case, when the bodies are not elastic. And
when they are elastic, the result of their collision is found by
combining the effect of the elasticity with the other effect, in
the same manner as in the last case.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">When</span> the bodies are perfectly elastic, the rule of
<span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Huygens</em></span><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> here is to divide the line C&nbsp;D (fig. 6.) in E as
before, and to take E&nbsp;G equal to E&nbsp;D. And by these points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
thus found, the motion of each body after the stroke is determined,
as before.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the next place, suppose the bodies A and B were
both moving the same way, but A with a swifter motion, so
as to overtake B, and strike against it. The effect of the percussion
or stroke, when the bodies are not elastic, is discovered
by finding the common motion, which the two bodies
would have after the stroke, if B were at rest, and A were to
advance against it with a velocity equal to the excess of the
present velocity of A above the velocity of B; and by adding
to this common velocity thus found the velocity of B.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the bodies are elastic, the effect of the elasticity is
to be united with this other, as in the former cases.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap gesperrt">When</span> the bodies are perfectly elastic, the rule of
<span class="smcap">Huygens</span><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> in this case is to prolong C&nbsp;D (fig. 7.) and to
take in it thus prolonged C&nbsp;E in the same proportion to E&nbsp;D,
as the greater velocity of A bears to the lesser velocity of B;
after which F&nbsp;G being taken equal to F&nbsp;E, the velocities of the
two bodies after the stroke will be determined, as in the two
preceding cases.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> I have given the sum of what has been written
concerning the effects of percussion, when two bodies
freely in motion strike directly against each other; and the
results here set down, as the consequence of our reasoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
from the laws of motion, answer most exactly to experience.
A particular set of experiments has been invented to make
trial of these effects of percussion with the greatest exactness.
But I must defer these experiments, till I have explained the
nature of pendulums<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. I shall therefore now proceed to describe
some of the appearances, which are caused in bodies
from the influence of the power of gravity united with the
general laws of motion; among which the motion of the
pendulum will be included.</p>

<p><a name="c55" id="c55">14.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> most simple of these appearances is, when bodies
fall down merely by their weight. In this case the body
increases continually its velocity, during the whole time of its
fall, and that in the very same proportion as the time increases.
For the power of gravity acts constantly on the body with
the same degree of strength: and it has been observed above
in the first law of motion, that a body being once in motion
will perpetually preserve that motion without the continuance
of any external influence upon it: therefore, after a body has
been once put in motion by the force of gravity, the body
would continue that motion, though the power of gravity
should cease to act any farther upon it; but, if the power of
gravity continues still to draw the body down, fresh degrees
of motion must continually be added to the body; and the
power of gravity acting at all times with the same strength,
equal degrees of motion will constantly be added in equal
portions of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> conclusion is not indeed absolutely true: for we
shall find hereafter<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>, that the power of gravity is not of the
same strength at all distances from the center of the earth. But
nothing of this is in the least sensible in any distance, to which
we can convey bodies. The weight of bodies is the very same
to sense upon the highest towers or mountains, as upon the
level ground; so that in all the observations we can make,
the forementioned proportion between the velocity of a falling
body and the time, in which it has been descending, obtains
without any the least perceptible difference.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> hence it follows, that the space, through which
a body falls, is not proportional to the time of the fall; for
since the body increases its velocity, a greater space will be
passed over in the same portion of time at the latter part of the
fall, than at the beginning. Suppose a body let fall from the
point A (in fig. 8.) were to descend from A to B in any portion
of time; then if in an equal portion of time it were to
proceed from B to C; I say, the space B&nbsp;C is greater than A&nbsp;B;
so that the time of the fall from A to C being double the time
of the fall from A to B, A&nbsp;C shall be more than double of A&nbsp;B.</p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> geometers have proved, that the spaces, through
which bodies fall thus by their weight, are just in a duplicate
or two-fold proportion of the times, in which the body has
been falling. That is, if we were to take the line D&nbsp;E in the
same proportion to A&nbsp;B, as the time, which the body has imployed
in falling from A to C, bears to the time of the fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
from A to B; then A&nbsp;C will be to D&nbsp;E in the same proportion.
In particular, if the time of the fall through A&nbsp;C be twice the
time of the fall through A&nbsp;B; then D&nbsp;E will be twice A&nbsp;B, and
A&nbsp;C twice D&nbsp;E; or A&nbsp;C four times A&nbsp;B. But if the time of the
fall through A&nbsp;C had been thrice the time of the fall through
A&nbsp;B; D&nbsp;E would have been treble of A&nbsp;B, and A&nbsp;C treble of
D&nbsp;E; that is, A&nbsp;C would have been equal to nine times A&nbsp;B.</p>

<p><a name="c57" id="c57">18.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> a body fall obliquely, it will approach the ground
by slower degrees, than when it falls perpendicularly. Suppose
two lines A&nbsp;B, A&nbsp;C (in fig. 9.) were drawn, one perpendicular,
and the other oblique to the ground D&nbsp;E: then if a
body were to descend in the slanting line A&nbsp;C; because the
power of gravity draws the body directly downwards, if the
line A&nbsp;C supports the body from falling in that manner, it
must take off part of the effect of the power of gravity; so
that in the time, which would have been sufficient for the
body to have fallen through the whole perpendicular line A&nbsp;B,
the body shall not have passed in the line A&nbsp;C a length equal
to A&nbsp;B; consequently the line A&nbsp;C being longer than A&nbsp;B,
the body shall most certainly take up more time in passing
through A&nbsp;C, than it would have done in falling perpendicularly
down through A&nbsp;B.</p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> geometers demonstrate, that the time, in which
the body will descend through the oblique straight line A&nbsp;C,
bears the same proportion to the time of its descent through
the perpendicular A&nbsp;B, as the line it self A&nbsp;C bears to A&nbsp;B.
And in respect to the velocity, which the body will have acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in the point C, they likewise prove, that the length of
the time imployed in the descent through A&nbsp;C so compensates
the diminution of the influence of gravity from the obliquity
of this line, that though the force of the power of gravity on
the body is opposed by the obliquity of the line A&nbsp;C, yet the
time of the body’s descent shall be so much prolonged, that
the body shall acquire the very same velocity in the point C,
as it would have got at the point B by falling perpendicularly
down.</p>

<p><a name="c58a" id="c58a">20.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> a body were to descend in a crooked line, the time
of its descent cannot be determined in so simple a manner;
but the same property, in relation to the velocity, is demonstrated
to take place in all cases: that is, in whatever line the
body descends, the velocity will always be answerable to the
perpendicular height, from which the body has fell. For instance,
suppose the body A (in fig. 10.) were hung by a
string to the pin B. If this body were let fall, till it came to
the point C perpendicularly under B, it will have moved from
A to C in the arch of a circle. Then the horizontal line A&nbsp;D
being drawn, the velocity of the body in C will be the same,
as if it had fallen from the point D directly down to C.</p>

<p><a name="c58b" id="c58b">21.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> a body be thrown perpendicularly upward with any
force, the velocity, wherewith the body ascends, shall
continually diminish, till at length it be wholly taken away;
and from that time the body will begin to fall down again,
and pass over a second time in its descent the line, wherein it
ascended; falling through this line with an increasing velocity
in such a manner, that in every point thereof, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
which it falls, it shall have the very same velocity, as it had in
the same place, when it ascended; and consequently shall come
down into the place, whence it first ascended, with the velocity
which was at first given to it. Thus if a body were thrown
perpendicularly up in the line A&nbsp;B (in fig. II.) with such a
force, as that it should stop at the point B, and there begin
to fall again; when it shall have arrived in its descent to any
point as C in this line, it shall there have the same velocity,
as that wherewith it passed by this point C in its ascent; and
at the point A it shall have gained as great a velocity, as
that wherewith it was first thrown upwards. As this is demonstrated
by the geometrical writers; so, I think, it will
appear evident, by considering only, that while the body descends,
the power of gravity must act over again, in an inverted
order, all the influence it had on the body in its ascent;
so as to give again to the body the same degrees of velocity,
which it had taken away before.</p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> the same manner, if the body were thrown
upwards in the oblique straight line C&nbsp;A (in fig. 9.) from the
point C, with such a degree of velocity as just to reach the
point A; it shall by its own weight return again through the
line A&nbsp;C by the same degrees, as it ascended.</p>

<p><a name="c59" id="c59">23.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">And</span> lastly, if a body were thrown with any velocity
in a line continually incurvated upwards, the like effect will
be produced upon its return to the point, whence it was
thrown. Suppose for instance, the body A (in fig. 12.) were
hung by a string A&nbsp;B. Then if this body be impelled any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
way, it must move in the arch of a circle. Let it receive such
an impulse, as shall cause it to move in the arch A&nbsp;C; and let
this impulse be of such strength, that the body may be carried
from A as far as D, before its motion is overcome by its
weight: I say here, that the body forthwith returning from
D, shall come again into the point A with the same velocity,
as that wherewith it began to move.</p>

<p><a name="c60" id="c60">24.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> will be proper in this place to observe concerning
the power of gravity, that its force upon any body does not
at all depend upon the shape of the body; but that it continues
constantly the same without any variation in the same
body, whatever change be made in the figure of the body: and
if the body be divided into any number of pieces, all those
pieces shall weigh just the same, as they did, when united
together in one body: and if the body be of a uniform contexture,
the weight of each piece will be proportional to its
bulk. This has given reason to conclude, that the power of
gravity acts upon bodies in proportion to the quantity of matter
in them. Whence it should follow, that all bodies must
fall from equal heights in the same space of time. And as
we evidently see the contrary in feathers and such like substances,
which fall very slowly in comparison of more solid
bodies; it is reasonable to suppose, that some other cause concurs
to make so manifest a difference. This cause has been
found by particular experiments to be the air. The experiments
for this purpose are made thus. They set up a very
tall hollow glass; within which near the top they lodge a feather
and some very ponderous body, usually a piece of gold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
this metal being the most weighty of any body known to us.
This glass they empty of the air contained within it, and by
moving a wire, which passes through the top of the glass, they
let the feather and the heavy body fall together; and it is always
found, that as the two bodies begin to descend at the
same time, so they accompany each other in the fall, and
come to the bottom at the very same instant, as near as the eye
can judge. Thus, as far as this experiment can be depended
on, it is certain, that the effect of the power of gravity upon
each body is proportional to the quantity of solid matter, or to
the power of inactivity in each body. For in the limited
sense, which we have given above to the word motion, it has
been shown, that the same force gives to all bodies the same
degree of motion, and different forces communicate different
degrees of motion proportional to the respective powers<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. In
this case, if the power of gravity were to act equally upon the
feather, and upon the more solid body, the solid body would
descend so much slower than the feather, as to have no greater
degree of motion than the feather: but as both bodies descend
with equal swiftness, the degree of motion in the solid
body is greater than in the feather, bearing the same proportion
to it, as the quantity of matter in the solid body to the
quantity of matter in the feather. Therefore the effect of
gravity on the solid body is greater than on the feather, in proportion
to the greater degree of motion communicated; that
is, the effect of the power of gravity on the solid body bears
the same proportion to its effect on the feather, as the quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of matter in the solid body bears to the quantity of matter
in the feather. Thus it is the proper deduction from this experiment,
that the power of gravity acts not on the surface of bodies
only, but penetrates the bodies themselves most intimately,
and operates alike on every particle of matter in them. But
as the great quickness, with which the bodies fall, leaves it
something uncertain, whether they do descend absolutely in
the same time, or only so nearly together, that the difference
in their swift motion is not discernable to the eye; this property
of the power of gravity, which has here been deduced
from this experiment, is farther confirmed by pendulums,
whose motion is such, that a very minute difference would
become sufficiently sensible. This will be farther discoursed
on in another place<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>; but here I shall make use of the principle
now laid down to explain the nature of what is called
the center of gravity in bodies.</p>

<p><a name="c62" id="c62">25.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> center of gravity is that point, by which if a
body be suspended, it shall hang at rest in any situation. In
a globe of a uniform texture the center of gravity is the same
with the center of the globe; for as the parts of the globe on
every side of its center are similarly disposed, and the power
of gravity acts alike on every part; it is evident, that the parts
of the globe on each side of the center are drawn with equal
force, and therefore neither side can yield to the other; but
the globe, if supported at its center, must of necessity hang
at rest. In like manner, if two equal bodies A and B (in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
fig. 13.) be hung at the extremities of an inflexible rod C&nbsp;D,
which should have no weight; these bodies, if the rod be
supported at its middle E, shall equiponderate; and the rod
remain without motion. For the bodies being equal and at
the same distance from the point of support E, the power of
gravity will act upon each with equal strength, and in all respects
under the same circumstances; therefore the weight of
one cannot overcome the weight of the other. The weight
of A can no more surmount the weight of B, than the weight
of B can surmount the weight of A. Again, suppose a body
as A&nbsp;B (in fig. 14.) of a uniform texture in the form of a
roller, or as it is more usually called a cylinder, lying horizontally.
If a straight line be drawn between C and D, the
centers of the extreme circles of this cylinder; and if this
straight line, commonly called the axis of the cylinder, be
divided into two equal parts in E: this point E will be the
center of gravity of the cylinder. The cylinder being a uniform
figure, the parts on each side of the point E are equal, and
situated in a perfectly similar manner; therefore this cylinder,
if supported at the point E, must hang at rest, for the
same reason as the inflexible rod above-mentioned will remain
without motion, when suspended at its middle point. And
it is evident, that the force applied to the point E, which
would uphold the cylinder, must be equal to the cylinder’s
weight. Now suppose two cylinders of equal thickness A&nbsp;B
and C&nbsp;D to be joined together at C&nbsp;B, so that the two axis’s
E&nbsp;F, and F&nbsp;G lie in one straight line. Let the axis E&nbsp;F be divided
into two equal parts at H, and the axis F&nbsp;G into two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
equal parts at I. Then because the cylinder A&nbsp;B would be
upheld at rest by a power applied in H equal to the weight of
this cylinder, and the cylinder C&nbsp;D would likewise be upheld
by a power applied in I equal to the weight of this cylinder;
the whole cylinder A&nbsp;D will be supported by these two powers:
but the whole cylinder may likewise be supported by a power
applied to K, the middle point of the whole axis E&nbsp;G, provided
that power be equal to the weight of the whole cylinder. It
is evident therefore, that this power applied in K will produce
the same effect, as the two other powers applied in H and I. It
is farther to be observed, that H&nbsp;K is equal to half F&nbsp;G, and
K&nbsp;I equal to half E&nbsp;F; for E&nbsp;K being equal to half E&nbsp;G, and E&nbsp;H
equal to half E&nbsp;F, the remainder H&nbsp;K must be equal to half
the remainder F&nbsp;G; so likewise G&nbsp;K being equal to half G&nbsp;E,
and G&nbsp;I equal to half G&nbsp;F, the remainder I&nbsp;K must be equal to
half the remainder E&nbsp;F. It follows therefore, that H&nbsp;K bears
the same proportion to K&nbsp;I, as F&nbsp;G bears to E&nbsp;F. Besides, I
believe, my readers will perceive, and it is demonstrated in
form by the geometers, that the whole body of the cylinder
C&nbsp;D bears the same proportion to the whole body of the cylinder
A&nbsp;B, as the axis F&nbsp;G bears to the axis E&nbsp;F<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. But hence
it follows, that in the two powers applied at H and I, the
power applied at H bears the same proportion to the power
applied at I, as K&nbsp;I bears to K&nbsp;H. Now suppose two strings
H&nbsp;L and I&nbsp;M extended upwards, one from the point H and the
other from I, and to be laid hold on by two powers, one
strong enough to hold up the cylinder A&nbsp;B, and the other of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
strength sufficient to support the cylinder C&nbsp;D. Here as these
two powers uphold the whole cylinder, and therefore produce
an effect, equal to what would have been produced by
a power applied to the point K of sufficient force to sustain the
whole cylinder: it is manifest, that if the cylinder be taken
away, the axis only being left, and from the point K a string,
as K&nbsp;N, be extended, which shall be drawn down by a power
equivalent to the weight of the cylinder, this power shall act
against the other two powers, as much as the cylinder acted
against them; and consequently these three powers shall be
upon a balance, and hold the axis H&nbsp;I fixed between them.
But if these three powers preserve a mutual balance, the
two powers applied to the strings H&nbsp;L and I&nbsp;M are a balance
to each other; the power applied to the string H&nbsp;L bearing
the same proportion to the power applied to the string I&nbsp;M,
as the distance I&nbsp;K bears to the distance K&nbsp;H.  Hence it farther
appears, that if an inflexible rod A&nbsp;B (in fig. 15.) be
suspended by any point C not in the middle thereof; and if
at A the end of the shorter arm be hung a weight, and at B
the end of the longer arm be also hung a weight less than
the other, and that the greater of these weights bears to the
lesser the same proportion, as the longer arm of the rod bears
to the shorter; then these two weights will equiponderate:
for a power applied at C equal to both these weights will support
without motion the rod thus charged; since here nothing
is changed from the preceding case but the situation
of the powers, which are now placed on the contrary
sides of the line, to which they are fixed. Also for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
same reason, if two weights A and B (in fig. 16.) were connected
together by an inflexible rod C&nbsp;D, drawn from C the
center of gravity of A to D the center of gravity of B; and
if the rod C&nbsp;D were to be so divided in E, that the part D&nbsp;E
bear the same proportion to the other part C&nbsp;E, as the weight
A bears to the weight B: then this rod being supported at E
will uphold the weights, and keep them at rest without motion.
This point E, by which the two bodies A and B will be
supported, is called their common center of gravity. And if
a greater number of bodies were joined together, the point, by
which they could all be supported, is called the common center
of gravity of them all. Suppose (in fig. 17.) there were three
bodies A, B, C, whose respective centers of gravity were joined
by the three lines D&nbsp;E, D&nbsp;F, E&nbsp;F: the line D&nbsp;E being so divided
in G, that D&nbsp;G bear the same proportion to G&nbsp;E, as B bears to
A; G is the center of gravity common to the two bodies A
and B; that is, a power equal to the weight of both the bodies
applied to G would support them, and the point G is
pressed as much by the two weights A and B, as it would be,
if they were both hung together at that point. Therefore,
if a line be drawn from G to F, and divided in H, so that G&nbsp;H
bear the same proportion to H&nbsp;F, as the weight C bears to
both the weights A and B, the point H will be the common
center of gravity of all the three weights; for H would be
their common center of gravity, if both the weights A and B
were hung together at G, and the point G is pressed as much
by them in their present situation, as it would be in that case.
In the same manner from the common center of these three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
weights, you might proceed to find the common center, if a
fourth weight were added, and by a gradual progress might
find the common center of gravity belonging to any number
of weights whatever.</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap gesperrt">As</span> all this is the obvious consequence of the proposition
laid down for assigning the common center of gravity of
any two weights, by the same proposition the center of gravity
of all figures is found. In a triangle, as A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C (in
fig. 18.) the center of gravity lies in the line drawn from the
middle point of any one of the sides to the opposite angle,
as the line B&nbsp;D is drawn from D the middle of the line A&nbsp;C to
the opposite angle B<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>; so that if from the middle of either
of the other sides, as from the point E in the side A&nbsp;B, a line
be drawn, as E&nbsp;C, to the opposite angle; the point F, where
this line crosses the other line B&nbsp;D, will be the center of gravity
of the triangle<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. Likewise D&nbsp;F is equal to half F&nbsp;B, and
E&nbsp;F equal to half F&nbsp;C<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. In a hemisphere, as A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C (fig. 19.)
if from D the center of the base the line D&nbsp;B be erected perpendicular
to that base, and this line be so divided in E, that
D&nbsp;E be equal to three fifths of B&nbsp;E, the point E is the center of
gravity of the hemisphere<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.</p>

<p>27. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> will be of use to observe concerning the center of
gravity of bodies; that since a power applied to this center
alone can support a body against the power of gravity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
hold it fixed at rest; the effect of the power of gravity on a
body is the same, as if that whole power were to exert itself
on the center of gravity only. Whence it follows, that, when
the power of gravity acts on a body suspended by any point,
if the body is so suspended, that the center of gravity of the
body can descend; the power of gravity will give motion to
that body, otherwise not: or if a number of bodies are so
connected together, that, when any one is put into motion,
the rest shall, by the manner of their being joined, receive
such motion, as shall keep their common center of gravity at
rest; then the power of gravity shall not be able to produce
any motion in these bodies, but in all other cases it will.
Thus, if the body A&nbsp;B (in fig. 20, 21.) whose center of gravity
is C, be hung on the point A, and the center C be perpendicularly
under A (as in fig. 20.) the weight of the body
will hold it still without motion, because the center C
cannot descend any lower. But if the body be removed into
any other situation, where the center C is not perpendicularly
under A (as in fig. 21.) the body by its weight will
be put into motion towards the perpendicular situation of its
center of gravity. Also if two bodies A, B (in fig. 22.) be
joined together by the rod C&nbsp;D lying in an horizontal situation,
and be supported at the point E; if this point be the
center of gravity common to the two bodies, their weight
will not put them into motion; but if this point E is not their
common center of gravity, the bodies will move; that part
of the rod C&nbsp;D descending, in which the common center of
gravity is found. So in like manner, if these two bodies were
connected together by any more complex contrivance; yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
if one of the bodies cannot move without so moving the
other, that their common center of gravity shall rest, the
weight of the bodies will not put them in motion, otherwise
it will.</p>

<p><a name="c69" id="c69">28.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> proceed in the next place to speak of the mechanical
powers. These are certain instruments or machines,
contrived for the moving great weights with small force; and
their effects are all deducible from the observation we have
just been making. They are usually reckoned in number
five; the lever, the wheel and axis, the pulley, the wedge,
and the screw; to which some add the inclined plane. As
these instruments have been of very ancient use, so the celebrated
<em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Archimedes</span></em> seems to have been the first, who discovered
the true reason of their effects. This, I think, may be
collected from what is related of him, that some expressions,
which he used to denote the unlimited force of these instruments,
were received as very extraordinary paradoxes:
whereas to those, who had understood the cause of their
great force, no expressions of that kind could have appeared
surprizing.</p>

<p>29. <span class="smcap gesperrt">All</span> the effects of these powers may be judged of by
this one rule, that, when two weights are applied to any of
these instruments, the weights will equiponderate, if, when
put into motion, their velocities will be reciprocally proportional
to their respective weights. And what is said of weights,
must of necessity be equally understood of any other forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
equivalent to weights, such as the force of a man’s arm, a
stream of water, or the like.</p>

<p>30. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> to comprehend the meaning of this rule, the
reader must know, what is to be understood by reciprocal
proportion; which I shall now endeavour to explain, as distinctly
as I can; for I shall be obliged very frequently to
make use of this term. When any two things are so related,
that one increases in the same proportion as the other, they are
directly proportional. So if any number of men can perform
in a determined space of time a certain quantity of any work,
suppose drain a fish-pond, or the like; and twice the number
of men can perform twice the quantity of the same work,
in the same time; and three times the number of men can
perform as soon thrice the work; here the number of men
and the quantity of the work are directly proportional. On
the other hand, when two things are so related, that one decreases
in the same proportion, as the other increases, they
are said to be reciprocally proportional. Thus if twice the
number of men can perform the same work in half the time,
and three times the number of men can finish the same in a
third part of the time; then the number of men and the
time are reciprocally proportional. We shewed above<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> how
to find the common center of gravity of two bodies, there
the distances of that common center from the centers of gravity
of the two bodies are reciprocally proportional to the respective
bodies.  For C&nbsp;E in fig. 16. being in the same proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to E&nbsp;D, as B bears to A; C&nbsp;E is so much greater in
proportion than E&nbsp;D, as A is less in proportion than B.</p>

<p>31. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> this being understood, the reason of the rule
here stated will easily appear. For if these two bodies were
put in motion, while the point E rested, the velocity, wherewith
A would move, would bear the same proportion to the
velocity, wherewith B would move, as E&nbsp;C bears to E&nbsp;D. The
velocity therefore of each body, when the common center
of gravity rests, is reciprocally proportional to the body. But
we have shewn above<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, that if two bodies are so connected together,
that the putting them in motion will not move their
common center of gravity; the weight of those bodies will
not produce in them any motion. Therefore in any of these
mechanical engines, if, when the bodies are put into motion,
their velocities are reciprocally proportional to their respective
weights, whereby the common center of gravity would remain
at rest; the bodies will not receive any motion from their
weight, that is, they will equiponderate. But this perhaps
will be yet more clearly conceived by the particular description
of each mechanical power.</p>

<p><a name="c71" id="c71">32.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> lever was first named above. This is a bar made
use of to sustain and move great weights. The bar is applied
in one part to some strong support; as the bar A&nbsp;B (in
fig. 23, 24.) is applied at the point C to the support D. In
some other part of the bar, as E, is applied the weight to be
sustained or moved; and in a third place, as F, is applied another
weight or equivalent force, which is to sustain or move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the weight at E. Now here, if, when the level should be
put in motion, and turned upon the point C, the velocity,
wherewith the point F would move, bears the same proportion
to the velocity, wherewith the point E would move, as
the weight at E bears to the weight or force at F; then the
lever thus charged will have no propensity to move either
way. If the weight or other force at F be not so great as to
bear this proportion, the weight at E will not be sustained;
but if the force at F be greater than this, the weight at E will
be surmounted. This is evident from what has been said
above<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, when the forces at E and F are placed (as in fig. 23.)
on different sides of the support D. It will appear also equally
manifest in the other case, by continuing the bar B&nbsp;C in
fig. 24. on the other side of the support D, till C&nbsp;G be equal
to C&nbsp;F, and by hanging at G a weight equivalent to the power
at F; for then, if the power at F were removed, the two
weights at G and E would counterpoize each other, as in
the former case: and it is evident, that the point F will
be lifted up by the weight at G with the same degree of
force, as by the other power applied to F; since, if the
weight at E were removed, a weight hung at F equal to
that at G would balance the lever, the distances C&nbsp;G and
C&nbsp;F being equal.</p>

<p>33. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the two weights, or other powers, applied to the
lever do not counterbalance each other; a third power may
be applied in any place proposed of the lever, which shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
hold the whole in a just counterpoize. Suppose (in fig. 25.)
the two powers at E and F did not equiponderate, and it were
required to apply a third power to the point G, that might be
sufficient to balance the lever. Find what power in F would
just counterbalance the power in E; then if the difference
between this power and that, which is actually applied at F,
bear the same proportion to the third power to be applied at
G, as the distance C&nbsp;G bears to C&nbsp;F; the lever will be counterpoized
by the help of this third power, if it be so applied
as to act the same way with the power in F, when that power
is too small to counterbalance the power in E; but otherwise
the power in G must be so applied, as to act against the
power in F. In like manner, if a lever were charged with three,
or any greater number of weights or other powers, which did
not counterpoize each other, another power might be applied
in any place proposed, which should bring the whole to a
just balance. And what is here said concerning a plurality of
powers, may be equally applied to all the following cases.</p>

<p>34. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the lever should consist of two arms making an
angle at the point C (as in fig. 26.) yet if the forces are applied
perpendicularly to each arm, the same proportion will
hold between the forces applied, and the distances of the center,
whereon the lever rests, from the points to which they
are applied. That is, the weight at E will be to the force in
F in the same proportion, as C&nbsp;F bears to C&nbsp;E.</p>

<p>35. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> whenever the forces applied to the lever act obliquely
to the arm, to which they are applied (as in fig. 27.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
then the strength of the forces is to be estimated by lines let
fall from the center of the lever to the directions, wherein the
forces act. To balance the levers in fig. 27, the weight or
other force at F will bear the same proportion to the weight
at E, as the distance C&nbsp;E bears to C&nbsp;G the perpendicular let fall
from the point C upon the line, which denotes the direction
wherein the force applied to F acts: for here, if the lever be
put into motion, the power applied to F will begin to move in
the direction of the line F&nbsp;G; and therefore its first motion will
be the same, as the motion of the point G.</p>

<p>36. <span class="smcap gesperrt">When</span> two weights hang upon a lever, and the point,
by which the lever is supported, is placed in the middle between
the two weights, that the arms of the lever are both
of equal length; then this lever is particularly called a balance;
and equal weights equiponderate as in common scales.
When the point of support is not equally distant from both
weights, it constitutes that instrument for weighing, which
is called a steelyard. Though both in common scales, and the
steelyard, the point, on which the beam is hung, is not usually
placed just in the same straight line with the points, that
hold the weights, but rather a little above (as in fig. 28.)
where the lines drawn from the point C, whereon the beam
is suspended, to the points E and F, on which the weights are
hung, do not make absolutely one continued line. If the
three points E, C, and F were in one straight line, those weights,
which equiponderated, when the beam hung horizontally,
would also equiponderate in any other situation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-125.jpg" width="400" height="513"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>But we see in these instruments, when they are charged with weights,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>which equiponderate with the beam hanging horizontally;
that, if the beam be inclined either way, the weight most
elevated surmounts the other, and descends, causing the beam
to swing, till by degrees it recovers its horizontal position.
This effect arises from the forementioned structure: for by
this structure these instruments are levers composed of two
arms, which make an angle at the point of support (as in
fig. 29, 30.) the first of which represents the case of the
common balance, the second the case of the steelyard. In
the first, where C&nbsp;E and C&nbsp;F are equal, equal weights hung
at E and F will equiponderate, when the points E and F are
in an horizontal situation. Suppose the lines E&nbsp;G and F&nbsp;H to
be perpendicular to the horizon, then they will denote the directions,
wherein the forces applied to E and F act. Therefore
the proportion between the weights at E and F, which
shall equiponderate, are to be judged of by perpendiculars,
as C&nbsp;I, C&nbsp;K, let fall from C upon E&nbsp;G and F&nbsp;H: so that the
weights being equal, the lines C&nbsp;I, C&nbsp;K, must be equal also,
when the weights equiponderate. But I believe my readers
will easily see, that since C&nbsp;E and C&nbsp;F are equal, the lines
C&nbsp;I and C&nbsp;K will be equal, when the points E and F are horizontally
situated.</p>

<p>37. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> this lever be set into any other position (as in
fig. 31.) then the weight, which is raised highest, will outweigh
the other. Here, if the point F be raised higher than
E, the perpendicular C&nbsp;K will be longer than C&nbsp;I: and therefore
the weights would equiponderate, if the weight at F<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
were less than the weight at E. But the weight at F is equal
to that at E; therefore is greater, than is necessary to counterbalance
the weight at E, and consequently will outweigh it,
and draw the beam of the lever down.</p>

<p>38. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> like manner in the case of the steelyard (fig. 32.)
if the weights at E and F are so proportioned, as to equiponderate,
when the points E and F are horizontally situated;
then in any other situation of this lever the weight, which is
raised highest, will preponderate. That is, if in the horizontal
situation of the points E and F the weight at F bears
the same proportion to the weight at E, as C&nbsp;I bears to C&nbsp;K;
then, if the point F be raised higher than E (as in fig. 32.)
the weight at F shall bear a greater proportion to the weight
at E, than C&nbsp;I bears to C&nbsp;K.</p>

<p>39. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Farther</span> a lever may be hung upon an axis, and
then the two arms of the lever need not be continuous, but
fixed to different parts of this axis; as in fig. 33, where
the axis A&nbsp;B is supported by its two extremities A and B. To
this axis one arm of the lever is fixed at the point C, the other
at the point D. Now here, if a weight be hung at E, the
extremity of that arm, which is fixed to the axis at the point
C; and another weight be hung at F, the extremity of the
arm, which is fixed on the axis at D; then these weights
will equiponderate, when the weight at E bears the same
proportion to the weight at F, as the arm D&nbsp;F bears to
C&nbsp;E.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>40. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> is the case, if both the arms are perpendicular
to the axis, and lie (as the geometers express themselves)
in the same plane; or, in other words, if the arms are so fixed
perpendicularly upon the axis, that, when one of them
lies horizontally, the other shall also be horizontal.  If either
arm stand not perpendicular to the axis; then, in determining
the proportion between the weights, instead of the
length of that arm, you must use the perpendicular let fall
upon the axis from the extremity of that arm.  If the arms
are not so fixed as to become horizontal, at the same time;
the method of assigning the proportion between the weights
is analogous to that made use of above in levers, which make
an angle at the point, whereon they are supported.</p>

<p><a name="c77" id="c77">41.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> this case of the lever hung on an axis, it is easy
to make a transition to another mechanical power, the
wheel and axis.</p>

<p>42. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> instrument is a wheel fixed on a roller, the
roller being supported at each extremity so as to turn
round freely with the wheel, in the manner represented in
fig. 34, where A&nbsp;B is the wheel, C&nbsp;D the roller, and E&nbsp;F its
two supports. Now suppose a weight G hung by a cord
wound round the roller, and another weight H hung by a
cord wound about the wheel the contrary way: that these
weights may support each other, the weight H must bear the
same proportion to the weight G, as the thickness of the roller
bears to the diameter of the wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>43. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Suppose</span> the line <i>k&nbsp;l</i> to be drawn through the middle
of the roller; and from the place of the roller, where
the cord, on which the weight G hangs, begins to leave the
roller, as at <i>m</i>, let the line<i> m&nbsp;n</i> be drawn perpendicularly to
<i>k&nbsp;l</i>; and from the point, where the cord holding the weight
H begins to leave the wheel, as at <i>o</i>, let the line <i>o&nbsp;p</i> be drawn
perpendicular to <i>k&nbsp;l</i>. This being done, the two lines <i>o&nbsp;p</i>
and <i>m&nbsp;n</i> represent two arms of a lever fixed on the axis <i>k&nbsp;l</i>;
consequently the weight H will bear to the weight G the same
proportion, as <i>m&nbsp;n</i> bears to <i>o&nbsp;p</i>. But <i>m&nbsp;n</i> bears the same proportion
to <i>o&nbsp;p</i>, as the thickness of the roller bears to the diameter
of the wheel; for <i>m&nbsp;n</i> is half the thickness of the roller,
and <i>o&nbsp;p</i> half the diameter of the wheel.</p>

<p>44. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the wheel be put into motion, and turned once
round, that the cord, on which the weight G hangs, be
wound once more round the axis; then at the same time the
cord, whereon the weight H hangs, will be wound off from
the wheel one circuit. Therefore the velocity of the weight
G will bear the same proportion to the velocity of the weight
H, as the circumference of the roller to the circumference of
the wheel. But the circumference of the roller bears the same
proportion to the circumference of the wheel, as the thickness
of the roller bears to the diameter of the wheel, consequently
the velocity of the weight G bears to the velocity
of the weight H the same proportion, as the thickness of
the roller bears to the diameter of the wheel, which is the
proportion that the weight H bears to the weight G. Therefore
as before in the lever, so here also the general rule laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
down above is verified, that the weights equiponderate, when
their velocities would be reciprocally proportional to their
respective weights.</p>

<p>45. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> like manner, if on the same axis two wheels of different
sizes are fixed (as in fig. 35.) and a weight hung on
each; the weights will equiponderate, if the weight hung on
the greater wheel bear the same proportion to the weight hung
on the lesser, as the diameter of the lesser wheel bears to the
diameter of the greater.</p>

<p>46. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is usual to join many wheels together in the same
frame, which by the means of certain teeth, formed in the circumference
of each wheel, shall communicate motion to each
other. A machine of this nature is represented in fig. 36. Here
A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C is a winch, upon which is fixed a small wheel D indented
with teeth, which move in the like teeth of a larger wheel
E&nbsp;F fixed on the axis G&nbsp;H. Let this axis carry another wheel
I, which shall move in like manner a greater wheel K&nbsp;L fixed
on the axis M&nbsp;N. Let this axis carry another small wheel O,
which after the same manner shall turn about a larger wheel
P&nbsp;Q fixed on the roller R&nbsp;S, on which a cord shall be wound,
that holds a weight, as T. Now the proportion required between
the weight T and a power applied to the winch at A
sufficient to support the weight, will most easily be estimated,
by computing the proportion, which the velocity of the point
A would bear to the velocity of the weight. If the winch be
turned round, the point A will describe a circle as A&nbsp;V. Suppose
the wheel E&nbsp;F to have ten times the number of teeth, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the wheel D; then the winch must turn round ten times to
carry the wheel E&nbsp;F once round. If wheel K&nbsp;L has also ten
times the number of teeth, as I, the wheel I must turn round
ten times to carry the wheel K&nbsp;L once round; and consequently
the winch A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C must turn round an hundred times
to turn the wheel K&nbsp;L once round. Lastly, if the wheel P&nbsp;Q
has ten times the number of teeth, as the wheel O, the winch
must turn about one thousand times in order to turn the wheel
P&nbsp;Q, or the roller R&nbsp;S once round. Therefore here the point
A must have gone over the circle A&nbsp;V a thousand times, in order
to lift the weight T through a space equal to the circumference
of the roller R&nbsp;S: whence it follows, that the power
applied at A will balance the weight T, if it bear the same
proportion to it, as the circumference of the roller to one
thousand times the circle A&nbsp;V; or the same proportion as half
the thickness of the roller bears to one thousand times A&nbsp;B.</p>

<p><a name="c80" id="c80">47.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> now explain the effect of the pulley. Let
a weight hang by a pulley, as in fig. 37. Here it is evident,
that the power A, by which the weight B is supported,
must be equal to the weight; for the cord C&nbsp;D is equally
strained between them; and if the weight B move, the power
A must move with equal velocity. The pulley E has no other
effect, than to permit the power A to act in another direction,
than it must have done, if it had been directly applied to support
the weight without the intervention of any such instrument.</p>

<p>48. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Again</span>, let a weight be supported, as in fig. 38;
where the weight A is fixed to the pulley B, and the cord, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
which the weight is upheld, is annexed by one extremity to a
hook C, and at the other end is held by the power D. Here
the weight is supported by a cord doubled; insomuch that
although the cord were not strong enough to hold the weight
single, yet being thus doubled it might support it. If the
end of the cord held by the power D were hung on the hook
C, as well as the other end; then, when both ends of the cord
were tied to the hook, it is evident, that the hook would
bear the whole weight; and each end of the string would
bear against the hook with the force of half the weight only,
seeing both ends together bear with the force of the whole.
Hence it is evident, that, when the power D holds one end of
the weight, the force, which it must exert to support the
weight, must be equal to just half the weight. And the same
proportion between the weight and power might be collected
from comparing the respective velocities, with which they
would move; for it is evident, that the power must move
through a space equal to twice the distance of the pulley from
the hook, in order to lift the pulley up to the hook.</p>

<p>49. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is equally easy to estimate the effect, when many
pulleys are combined together, as in fig. 39, 40; in the first
of which the under set of pulleys, and consequently the
weight is held by six strings; and in the latter figure by five:
therefore in the first of these figures the power to support the
weight, must be one sixth part only of the weight, and in
the latter figure the power must be one fifth part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>50. <span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> are two other ways of supporting a weight
by pulleys, which I shall particularly consider.</p>

<p>51. <span class="smcap gesperrt">One</span> of these ways is represented in fig. 41. Here the
weight being connected to the pulley B, a power equal to
half the weight A would support the pulley C, if applied immediately
to it. Therefore the pulley C is drawn down
with a force equal to half the weight A. But if the pulley D
were to be immediately supported by half the force, with
which the pulley C is drawn down, this pulley D will uphold
the pulley C; so that if the pulley D be upheld with a force
equal to one fourth part of the weight A, that force will support
the weight. But, for the same reason as before, if the
power in E be equal to half the force necessary to uphold the
pulley D; this pulley, and consequently the weight A, will
be upheld: therefore, if the power in E be one eighth part
of the weight A, it will support the weight.</p>

<p>52. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Another</span> way of applying pulleys to a weight is
represented in fig. 42. To explain the effect of pulleys thus
applied, it will be proper to consider different weights hanging,
as in fig. 43. Here, if the power and weights balance each
other, the power A is equal to the weight B; the weight C is
equal to twice the power A, or the weight B; and for the same
reason the weight D is equal to twice the weight C, or equal
to four times the power A. It is evident therefore, that all
the three weights B, C, D together are equal to seven times the
power A. But if these three weights were joined in one, they
would produce the case of fig. 40: so that in that figure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
weight A, where there are three pulleys, is seven times the
power B. If there had been but two pulleys, the weight would
have been three times the power; and if there had been four
pulleys, the weight would have been fifteen times the power.</p>

<p><a name="c83a" id="c83a">53.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> wedge is next to be considered. The form of
this instrument is sufficiently known. When it is put under
any weight (as in fig. 44.) the force, with which the wedge
will lift the weight, when drove under it by a blow upon the
end A&nbsp;B, will bear the same proportion to the force, wherewith
the blow would act on the weight, if directly applied to
it; as the velocity, which the wedge receives from the blow,
bears to the velocity, wherewith the weight is lifted by the
wedge.</p>

<p><a name="c83b" id="c83b">54.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> screw is the fifth mechanical power. There are
two ways of applying this instrument. Sometimes it is screwed
into a hole, as in fig. 45, where the screw A&nbsp;B is screwed
through the plank C&nbsp;D. Sometimes the screw is applied to
the teeth of a wheel, as in fig. 46, where the thread of the
screw A&nbsp;B turns in the teeth of a wheel C&nbsp;D. In both these
cases, if a bar, as A&nbsp;E, be fixed to the end A of the screw; the
force, wherewith the end B of the screw in fig. 45 is
forced down, and the force, wherewith the teeth of the
wheel C&nbsp;D in fig. 44 are held, bears the same proportion
to the power applied to the end E of the bar; as the velocity,
wherewith the end E will move, when the screw is turned,
bears to the velocity, wherewith the end B of the screw in fig.
43, or the teeth of the wheel C&nbsp;D in fig. 46, will be moved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="c84" id="c84">55.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> inclined plane affords also a means of raising
a weight with less force, than what is equal to the weight it
self. Suppose it were required to raise the globe A (in fig.
47.) from the ground B&nbsp;C up to the point, whose perpendicular
height from the ground is E&nbsp;D. If this globe be drawn
along the slant D&nbsp;F, less force will be required to raise it, than
if it were lifted directly up. Here if the force applied to the
globe bear the same proportion only to its weight, as E&nbsp;D bears
to F&nbsp;D, it will be sufficient to hold up the globe; and therefore
any addition to that force will put it in motion, and draw
it up; unless the globe, by pressing against the plane, whereon
it lies, adhere in some degree to the plane. This indeed
it must always do more or less, since no plane can be made so
absolutely smooth as to have no inequalities at all; nor yet so
infinitely hard, as not to yield in the least to the pressure of the
weight. Therefore the globe cannot be laid on such a plane,
whereon it will slide with perfect freedom, but they must in
some measure rub against each other; and this friction will
make it necessary to imploy a certain degree of force more,
than what is necessary to support the globe, in order to give
it any motion. But as all the mechanical powers are subject
in some degree or other to the like impediment from friction;
I shall here only shew what force would be necessary to sustain
the globe, if it could lie upon the plane without causing
any friction at all. And I say, that if the globe were
drawn by the cord G&nbsp;H, lying parallel to the plane D&nbsp;F; and
the force, wherewith the cord is pulled, bear the same
proportion to the weight of the globe, as E&nbsp;D bears to D&nbsp;F;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
this force will sustain the globe. In order to the making
proof of this, let the cord G&nbsp;H be continued on, and turned
over the pulley I, and let the weight K be hung to it.
Now I say, if this weight bears the same proportion to
the globe A, as D&nbsp;E bears to D&nbsp;F, the weight will support
the globe. I think it is very manifest, that the center of the
globe A will lie in one continued line with the cord H&nbsp;G. Let
L be the center of the globe, and M the center of gravity of
the weight K. In the first place let the weight hang so, that
a line drawn from L to M shall lie horizontally; and I say,
if the globe be moved either up or down the plane D&nbsp;F, the
weight will so move along with it, that the center of gravity
common to both the weights shall continue in this line L&nbsp;M,
and therefore shall in no case descend. To prove this more
fully, I shall depart a little from the method of this treatise,
and make use of a mathematical proportion or two: but they
are such, as any person, who has read <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Euclid’s Elements</em></span>,
will fully comprehend; and are in themselves so evident, that,
I believe, my readers, who are wholly strangers to geometrical
writings, will make no difficulty of admitting them. This
being premised, let the globe be moved up, till its center be
at G, then will M the center of gravity of the weight K be
sunk to N; so that M&nbsp;N shall be equal to G&nbsp;L. Draw N&nbsp;G
crossing the line M&nbsp;L in O; then I say, that O is the common
center of gravity of the two weights in this their new situation.
Let G&nbsp;P be drawn perpendicular to M&nbsp;L; then G&nbsp;L will
bear the same proportion to G&nbsp;P, as D&nbsp;F bears to D&nbsp;E; and
M&nbsp;N being equal to G&nbsp;L, M&nbsp;N will bear the same proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to G&nbsp;P, as D&nbsp;F bears to D&nbsp;E. But N&nbsp;O bears the same proportion
to O&nbsp;G, as M&nbsp;N bears to G&nbsp;P; consequently N&nbsp;O will bear
the same proportion to O&nbsp;G, as D&nbsp;F bears to D&nbsp;E. In the last
place, the weight of the globe A bears the same proportion to
the other weight K, as D&nbsp;F bears to D&nbsp;E; therefore N&nbsp;O bears
the same proportion to O&nbsp;G, as the weight of the globe A bears
to the weight K. Whence it follows, that, when the center
of the globe A is in G, and the center of gravity of the weight
K is in N, O will be the center of gravity common to both
the weights. After the same manner, if the globe had been
caused to descend, the common center of gravity would have
been found in this line M&nbsp;L. Since therefore no motion of
the globe either way will make the common center of gravity
descend, it is manifest, from what has been said above, that
the weights A and K counterpoize each other.</p>

<p><a name="c86a" id="c86a">56.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> now consider the case of pendulums. A
pendulum is made by hanging a weight to a line, so that it
may swing backwards and forwards. This motion the geometers
have very carefully considered, because it is the most
commodious instrument of any for the exact measurement of
time.</p>

<p><a name="c86b" id="c86b">57.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">I have</span> observed already<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, that if a body hanging
perpendicularly by a string, as the body A (in fig. 48.) hangs
by the string A&nbsp;B, be put so into motion, as to be made to ascend
up the circular arch A&nbsp;C; then as soon as it has arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
at the highest point, to which the motion, that the body has
received, will carry it; it will immediately begin to descend,
and at A will receive again as great a degree of motion, as it
had at first. This motion therefore will carry the body up
the arch A&nbsp;D, as high as it ascended before in the arch A&nbsp;C.
Consequently in its return through the arch D&nbsp;A it will acquire
again at A its original velocity, and advance a second time up
the arch A&nbsp;C as high as at first; by this means continuing without
end its reciprocal motion. It is true indeed, that in fact
every pendulum, which we can put in motion, will gradually
lessen its swing, and at length stop, unless there be some
power constantly applied to it, whereby its motion shall be
renewed; but this arises from the resistance, which the body
meets with both from the air, and the string by which it is
hung: for as the air will give some obstruction to the progress
of the body moving through it; so also the string, whereon
the body hangs, will be a farther impediment; for this string
must either slide on the pin, whereon it hangs, or it must bend
to the motion of the weight; in the first there must be some
degree of friction, and in the latter the string will make some
resistance to its inflection. However, if all resistance could
be removed, the motion of a pendulum would be perpetual.</p>

<p>58. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> to proceed, the first property, I shall take notice
of in this motion, is, that the greater arch the pendulous
body moves through, the greater time it takes up: though
the length of time does not increase in so great a proportion
as the arch. Thus if C&nbsp;D be a greater arch, and E&nbsp;F a lesser,
where C&nbsp;A is equal to A&nbsp;D, and E&nbsp;A equal to A&nbsp;F; the body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
when it swings through the greater arch C&nbsp;D, shall take up in
its swing from C to D a longer time than in swinging from E
to F, when it moves only in that lesser arch; or the time in
which the body let fall from C will descend through the arch
C&nbsp;A is greater than the time, in which it will descend through
the arch E&nbsp;A, when let fall from E. But the first of these
times will not hold the same proportion to the latter, as the
first arch C&nbsp;A bears to the other arch E&nbsp;A; which will appear
thus. Let C&nbsp;G and E&nbsp;H be two horizontal lines. It has been
remarked above<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, that the body in falling through the arch
C&nbsp;A will acquire as great a velocity at the point A, as it would
have gained by falling directly down through G&nbsp;A; and in
falling through the arch E&nbsp;A it will acquire in the point A only
that velocity, which it would have got in falling through
H&nbsp;A. Therefore, when the body descends through the greater
arch C&nbsp;A, it shall gain a greater velocity, than when it passes
only through the lesser; so that this greater velocity will in
some degree compensate the greater length of the arch.</p>

<p>59. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> increase of velocity, which the body acquires
in falling from a greater height, has such an effect, that, if
straight lines be drawn from A to C and E, the body would
fall through the longer straight line C&nbsp;A just in the same time,
as through the shorter straight line E&nbsp;A. This is demonstrated
by the geometers, who prove, that if any circle, as A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D
(fig. 49.) be placed in a perpendicular situation; a body
shall fall obliquely through every line, as A&nbsp;B drawn from the
lowest point A in the circle to any other point in the circumference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
just in the same time, as would be imployed by the
body in falling perpendicularly down through the diameter
C&nbsp;A. But the time in which the body will descend through
the arch, is different from the time, which it would take up
in falling through the line A&nbsp;B.</p>

<p>60. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> has been thought by some, that because in very
small arches this correspondent straight line differs but little
from the arch itself; therefore the descent through this
straight line would be performed in such small arches nearly
in the same time as through the arches themselves: so that
if a pendulum were to swing in small arches, half the time
of a single swing would be nearly equal to the time, in which
a body would fall perpendicularly through twice the length
of the pendulum. That is, the whole time of the swing, according
to this opinion, will be four fold the time required
for the body to fall through half the length of the pendulum;
because the time of the body’s falling down twice the
length of the pendulum is half the time required for the fall
through one quarter of this space, that is through half the
pendulum’s length. However there is here a mistake; for
the whole time of the swing, when the pendulum moves
through small arches, bears to the time required for a body
to fall down through half the length of the pendulum very
nearly the same proportion, as the circumference of a circle
bears to its diameter; that is very nearly the proportion of
355 to 113, or little more than the proportion of 3 to 1.
If the pendulum takes so great a swing, as to pass over an arch
equal to one sixth part of the whole circumference of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
circle, it will swing 115 times, while it ought according to
this proportion to have swung 117 times; so that, when it
swings in so large an arch, it loses something less than two
swings in an hundred. If it swing through 1/10 only of the
circle, it shall not lose above one vibration in 160. If it
swing in 1/20 of the circle, it shall lose about one vibration in
690. If its swing be confined to 1/40 of the whole circle, it
shall lose very little more than one swing in 2600. And
if it take no greater a swing than through 1/60 of the whole circle,
it shall not lose one swing in 5800.</p>

<p>61. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> it follows from hence, that, when pendulums
swing in small arches, there is very nearly a constant proportion
observed between the time of their swing, and the time,
in which a body would fall perpendicularly down through
half their length. And we have declared above, that the
spaces, through which bodies fall, are in a two fold proportion
of the times, which they take up in falling<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. Therefore
in pendulums of different lengths, swinging through small
arches, the lengths of the pendulums are in a two fold or
duplicate proportion of the times, they take in swinging;
so that a pendulum of four times the length of another shall
take up twice the time in each swing, one of nine times the
length will make one swing only for three swings of the
shorter, and so on.</p>

<p>62. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> proportion in the swings of different pendulums
not only holds in small arches; but in large ones also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
provided they be such, as the geometers call similar; that
is, if the arches bear the same proportion to the whole circumferences
of their respective circles. Suppose (in fig. 48.)
A&nbsp;B, C&nbsp;D to be two pendulums. Let the arch E&nbsp;F be described
by the motion of the pendulum A&nbsp;B, and the arch G&nbsp;H
be described by the pendulum C&nbsp;D; and let the arch E&nbsp;F bear
the same proportion to the whole circumference, which
would be formed by turning the pendulum A&nbsp;B quite round
about the point A, as the arch G&nbsp;H bears to the whole circumference,
that would be formed by turning the pendulum
C&nbsp;D quite round the point C. Then I say, the proportion,
which the length of the pendulum A&nbsp;B bears to the
length of the pendulum C&nbsp;D, will be two fold of the proportion,
which the time taken up in the description of the arch
E&nbsp;F bears to the time employed in the description of the arch
G&nbsp;H.</p>

<p><a name="c91" id="c91">63.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> pendulums, which swing in very small arches,
are nearly an equal measure of time. But as they are not such
an equal measure to geometrical exactness; the mathematicians
have found out a method of causing a pendulum so to swing,
that, if its motion were not obstructed by any resistance, it
would always perform each swing in the same time, whether
it moved through a greater, or a lesser space. This was first
discovered by the great <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Huygens</em></span>, and is as follows. Upon
the straight line A&nbsp;B (in fig. 49.) let the circle C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E be so
placed, as to touch the straight line in the point C. Then let
this circle roll along upon the straight line A&nbsp;B, as a coach-wheel
rolls along upon the ground. It is evident, that, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
soon as ever the circle begins to move, the point C in the circle
will be lifted off from the straight line A&nbsp;B; and in the
motion of the circle will describe a crooked course, which is
represented by the line C&nbsp;F&nbsp;G&nbsp;H. Here the part C&nbsp;H of the
straight line included between the two extremities C and H
of the line C&nbsp;F&nbsp;G&nbsp;H will be equal to the whole circumference
of the circle C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E; and if C&nbsp;H be divided into two equal
parts at the point I, and the straight line I&nbsp;K be drawn perpendicular
to C&nbsp;H, this line I&nbsp;K will be equal to the diameter
of the circle C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E. Now in this line if a body were to be
let fall from the point H, and were to be carried by its weight
down the line H&nbsp;G&nbsp;K, as far as the point K, which is the lowest
point of the line C&nbsp;F&nbsp;G&nbsp;H; and if from any other point G a
body were to be let fall in the same manner; this body,
which falls from G, will take just the same time in coming to
K, as the body takes up, which falls from H. Therefore if
a pendulum can be so hung, that the ball shall move in the
line A&nbsp;G&nbsp;F&nbsp;E, all its swings, whether long or short, will be performed
in the same time; for the time, in which the ball
will descend to the point K, is always half the time of the
whole swing. But the ball of a pendulum will be made to
swing in this line by the following means. Let K&nbsp;I (in fig.
52.) be prolonged upwards to L, till I&nbsp;L is equal to I&nbsp;K.
Then let the line L&nbsp;M&nbsp;H equal and like to K&nbsp;H be applied, as
in the figure between the points L and H, so that the point
which in this line L&nbsp;M&nbsp;H answers to the point H in the line
K&nbsp;H shall be applied to the point L, and the point answering
to the point K shall be applied to the point H. Also let such
another line L&nbsp;N&nbsp;C be applied between L and C in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
manner. This preparation being made; if a pendulum be
hung at the point L of such a length, that the ball thereof
shall reach to K; and if the string shall continually bend against
the lines H&nbsp;M&nbsp;L and L&nbsp;N&nbsp;C, as the pendulum swings
to and fro; by this means the ball shall constantly keep in
the line C&nbsp;K&nbsp;H.</p>

<p><a name="c93" id="c93">64.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> in this pendulum, as all the swings, whether
long or short, will be performed in the same time; so the time
of each will exactly bear the same proportion to the time required
for a body to fall perpendicularly down, through half
the length of the pendulum, that is from I to K, as the circumference
of a circle bears to its diameter.</p>

<p>65. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> may from hence be understood in some measure,
why, when pendulums swing in circular arches, the times of
their swings are nearly equal, if the arches are small, though
those arches be of very unequal lengths; for if with the semidiameter
L&nbsp;K the circular arch O&nbsp;K&nbsp;P be described, this arch
in the lower part of it will differ very little from the line
C&nbsp;K&nbsp;H.</p>

<p>66. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> may not be amiss here to remark, that a body
will fall in this line C&nbsp;K&nbsp;H (fig. 53.) from C to any other
point, as Q or R in a shorter space of time, than if it moved
through the straight line drawn from C to the other point;
or through any other line whatever, that can be drawn between
these two points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>67. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> as I have observed, that the time, which a pendulum
takes in swinging, depends upon its length; I shall
now say something concerning the way, in which this length
of the pendulum is to be estimated. If the whole ball of the
pendulum could be crouded into one point, this length, by
which the motion of the pendulum is to be computed, would
be the length of the string or rod. But the ball of the pendulum
must have a sensible magnitude, and the several parts
of this ball will not move with the same degree of swiftness;
for those parts, which are farthest from the point, whereon
the pendulum is suspended, must move with the greatest velocity.
Therefore to know the time in which the pendulum
swings, it is necessary to find that point of the ball, which
moves with the same degree of velocity, as if the whole ball
were to be contracted into that point.</p>

<p><a name="c94" id="c94">68.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> point is not the center of gravity, as I shall now
endeavour to shew. Suppose the pendulum A&nbsp;B (in fig. 54.)
composed of an inflexible rod A&nbsp;C and ball C&nbsp;B, to be fixed
on the point A, and lifted up into an horizontal situation.
Here if the rod were not fixed to the point A, the body C&nbsp;B
would descend directly with the whole force of its weight;
and each part of the body would move down with the same
degree of swiftness. But when the rod is fixed at the point
A, the body must fall after another manner; for the parts
of the body must move with different degrees of velocity,
the parts more remote from A descending with a swifter motion,
than the parts nearer to A; so that the body will receive
a kind of rolling motion while it descends. But it has
been observed above, that the effect of gravity upon any body
is the same, as if the whole force were exerted on the body’s
center of gravity<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Since therefore the power of gravity
in drawing down the body must also communicate to it the
rolling motion just described; it seems evident, that the center
of gravity of the body cannot be drawn down as swiftly,
as when the power of gravity has no other effect to produce
on the body, than merely to draw it downward. If therefore
the whole matter of the body C&nbsp;B could be crouded into
its center of gravity, so that being united into one point, this
rolling motion here mentioned might give no hindrance to
its descent; this center would descend faster, than it can now
do. And the point, which now descends as fast, as if the
whole matter or the body C&nbsp;B were crouded into it, will be
farther removed from the point A, than the center of gravity
of the body C&nbsp;B.</p>

<p>69. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Again</span>, suppose the pendulum A&nbsp;B (in fig. 55.) to
hang obliquely. Here the power of gravity will operate less
upon the ball of the pendulum, than before: but the line D&nbsp;E
being drawn so, as to stand perpendicular to the rod A&nbsp;C of
the pendulum; the force of gravity upon the body C&nbsp;B,
now it is in this situation, will produce the same effect, as
if the body were to glide down an inclined plane in the position
of D&nbsp;E. But here the motion of the body, when the
rod is fixed to the point A, will not be equal to the uninterrupted
descent of the body down this plane; for the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
will here also receive the same kind of rotation in its motion,
as before; so that the motion of the center of gravity will in
like manner be retarded; and the point, which here descends
with that degree of swiftness, which the body would
have, if not hindered by being fixed to the point A; that is,
the point, which descends as fast, as if the whole body were
crouded into it, will be as far removed from the point A, as
before.</p>

<p>70. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> point, by which the length of the pendulum is
to be estimated, is called the center of oscillation. And the
mathematicians have laid down general directions, whereby
to find this center in all bodies. If the globe A&nbsp;B (in fig. 56.)
be hung by the string C&nbsp;D, whose weight need not be regarded,
the center of oscillation is found thus. Let the
straight line drawn from C to D be continued through the
globe to F. That it will pass through the center of the globe
is evident. Suppose E to be this center of the globe; and
take the line G of such a length, that it shall bear the same
proportion to E&nbsp;D, as E&nbsp;D bears to E&nbsp;C. Then E&nbsp;H being
made equal to ⅖ of G, the point H shall be the center of oscillation<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.
If the weight of the rod C&nbsp;D is too considerable
to be neglected, divide C&nbsp;D (fig. 57) in I, that D&nbsp;I be equal
to ⅓, part of C&nbsp;D; and take K in the same proportion to C&nbsp;I, as
the weight of the globe A&nbsp;B to the weight of the rod C&nbsp;D.
Then having found H, the center of oscillation of the globe, as
before, divide I&nbsp;K in I, so that I&nbsp;L shall bear the same proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to L&nbsp;H, as the line C&nbsp;H bears to K; and L shall be
the center of oscillation of the whole pendulum.</p>

<p>71. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> computation is made upon supposition, that the
center of oscillation of the rod C&nbsp;D, if that were to swing alone
without any other weight annexed, would be the point I.
And this point would be the true center of oscillation, so far
as the thickness of the rod is not to be regarded. If any one
chuses to take into consideration the thickness of the rod, he
must place the center of oscillation thereof so much below
the point I, that eight times the distance of the center from
the point I shall bear the same proportion to the thickness of
the rod, as the thickness of the rod bears to its length C&nbsp;D<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p>72. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> has been observed above, that when a pendulum
swings in an arch of a circle, as here in fig. 58, the pendulum
A&nbsp;B swings in the circular arch C&nbsp;D; if you draw an horizontal
line, as E&nbsp;F, from the place whence the pendulum is
let fall, to the line A&nbsp;G, which is perpendicular to the horizon:
then the velocity, which the pendulum will acquire in coming
to the point G, will be the same, as any body would acquire
in falling directly down from F to G. Now this is to be
understood of the circular arch, which is described by the center
of oscillation of the pendulum. I shall here farther observe,
that if the straight line E&nbsp;G be drawn from the point,
whence the pendulum falls, to the lowest point of the arch;
in the same or in equal pendulums the velocity, which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
pendulum acquires in G, is proportional to this line: that is, if
the pendulum, after it has descended from E to G, be taken
back to H, and let fall from thence, and the line H&nbsp;G be
drawn; the velocity, which the pendulum shall acquire in
G by its descent from H, shall bear the same proportion to
the velocity, which it acquires in falling from E to G, as the
straight line H&nbsp;G bears to the straight line E&nbsp;G.</p>

<p><a name="c98" id="c98">73.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> may now proceed to those experiments upon the
percussion of bodies, which I observed above might be
made with pendulums. This expedient for examining the
effects of percussion was first proposed by our late great
architect Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Christopher Wren</em></span>. And it is as follows.
Two balls, as A and B (in fig. 59.) either equal or unequal,
are hung by two strings from two points C and D, so
that, when the balls hang down without motion, they shall
just touch each other, and the strings be parallel. Here if
one of these balls be removed to any distance from its perpendicular
situation, and then let fall to descend and strike against
the other; by the last preceding paragraph it will be
known, with what velocity this ball shall return into its first
perpendicular situation, and consequently with what force it
shall strike against the other ball; and by the height to which
this other ball ascends after the stroke, the velocity communicated
to this ball will be discovered. For instance, let the
ball A be taken up to E, and from thence be let fall to strike
against B, passing over in its descent the circular arch E&nbsp;F.
By this impulse let B fly up to G, moving through the circular
arch H&nbsp;G. Then E&nbsp;I and G&nbsp;K being drawn horizontally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the ball A will strike against B with the velocity, which it
would acquire in falling directly down from I; and the ball
B has received a velocity, wherewith, if it had been thrown
directly upward, it would have ascended up to K. Likewise
if straight lines be drawn from E to F and from H to G, the
velocity of A, wherewith it strikes, will bear the same proportion
to the velocity, which B has received by the blow, as
the straight line E&nbsp;F bears to the straight line H&nbsp;G. In the
same manner by noting the place to which A ascends after the
stroke, its remaining velocity may be compared with that,
wherewith it struck against B. Thus may be experimented
the effects of the body A striking against B at rest. If both
the bodies are lifted up, and so let fall as to meet and impinge
against each other just upon the coming of both into their
perpendicular situation; by observing the places into which
they move after the stroke, the effects of their percussion in
all these cases may be found in the same manner as before.</p>

<p>74. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Sir <em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> has described these experiments;
and has shewn how to improve them to a greater exactness by
making allowance for the resistance, which the air gives to
the motion of the balls<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. But as this resistance is exceeding
small, and the manner of allowing for it is delivered by himself
in very plain terms, I need not enlarge upon it here. I
shall rather speak to a discovery, which he made by these experiments
upon the elasticity of bodies. It has been explained
above<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>, that when two bodies strike, if they be not elastic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
they remain contiguous after the stroke; but that if they are
elastic, they separate, and that the degree of their elasticity
determines the proportion between the celerity wherewith
they separate, and the celerity wherewith they meet. Now
our author found, that the degree of elasticity appeared in
the same bodies always the same, with whatever degree of
force they struck; that is, the celerity wherewith they separated,
always bore the same proportion to the celerity
wherewith they met: so that the elastic power in all the bodies,
he made trial upon, exerted it self in one constant proportion
to the compressing force. Our author made trial
with balls of wool bound up very compact, and found the
celerity with which they receded, to bear about the proportion
of 5 to 9 to the celerity wherewith they met; and in
steel he found nearly the same proportion; in cork the elasticity
was something less; but in glass much greater; for the
celerity, wherewith balls of that material separated after percussion,
he found to bear the proportion of 15 to 16 to the
celerity wherewith they met<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c100" id="c100">75.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> finish my discourse on pendulums, with
this farther observation only, that the center of oscillation is
also the center of another force. If a body be fixed to any
point, and being put in motion turns round it; the body, if
uninterrupted by the power of gravity or any other means,
will continue perpetually to move about with the same equable
motion.  Now the force, with which such a body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
moves, is all united in the point, which in relation to the
power of gravity is called the center of oscillation. Let the
cylinder A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D (in fig. 60.) whose axis is E&nbsp;F, be fixed to
the point E. And supposing the point E to be that on which
the cylinder is suspended, let the center of oscillation be
found in the axis E&nbsp;F, as has been explained above<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. Let G
be that center: then I say, that the force, wherewith this cylinder
turns round the point E, is so united in the point G, that
a sufficient force applied in that point shall stop the motion of
the cylinder, in such a manner, that the cylinder should immediately
remain without motion, though it were to be loosened
from the point E at the same instant, that the impediment
was applied to G: whereas, if this impediment had been
applied to any other point of the axis, the cylinder would
turn upon the point, where the impediment was applied. If
the impediment had been applied between E and G, the cylinder
would so turn on the point, where the impediment
was applied, that the end B&nbsp;C would continue to move on
the same way it moved before along with the whole cylinder;
but if the impediment were applied to the axis farther off from
E than G, the end A&nbsp;D of the cylinder would start out of its
present place that way in which the cylinder moved. From
this property of the center of oscillation, it is also called the
center of percussion. That excellent mathematician, Dr. <span class="smcap">Brook
Taylor</span>, has farther improved this doctrine concerning the
center of percussion, by shewing, that if through this point
G a line, as G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I, be drawn perpendicular to E&nbsp;F, and lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in the course of the body’s motion; a sufficient power applied
to any point of this line will have the same effect, as the
like power applied to G<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>: so that as we before shewed the
center of percussion within the body on its axis; by this means
we may find this center on the surface of the body also, for
it will be where this line H&nbsp;I crosses that surface.</p>

<p><a name="c102" id="c102">76.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> now proceed to the last kind of motion, to
be treated on in this place, and shew what line the power of
gravity will cause a body to describe, when it is thrown forwards
by any force. This was first discovered by the great
<span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Galileo</em></span>, and is the principle, upon which engineers
should direct the shot of great guns. But as in this case bodies
describe in their motion one of those lines, which in geometry
are called conic sections; it is necessary here to premise
a description of those lines. In which I shall be the
more particular, because the knowledge of them is not only
necessary for the present purpose, but will be also required
hereafter in some of the principal parts of this treatise.</p>

<p>77. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> first lines considered by the ancient geometers
were the straight line and the circle. Of these they composed
various figures, of which they demonstrated many properties,
and resolved divers problems concerning them. These
problems they attempted always to resolve by the describing
straight lines and circles. For instance, let a square A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D
(fig. 61.) be proposed, and let it be required to make another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
square in any assigned proportion to this. Prolong one
side, as D&nbsp;A, of this square to E, till A&nbsp;E bear the same proportion
to A&nbsp;D, as the new square is to bear to the square A&nbsp;C.
If the opposite side B&nbsp;C of the square A&nbsp;C be also prolonged
to F, till B&nbsp;F be equal to A&nbsp;E, and E&nbsp;F be afterwards drawn,
I suppose my readers will easily conceive, that the figure A&nbsp;B&nbsp;F&nbsp;E
will bear to the square A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D the same proportion, as the line
A&nbsp;E bears to the line A&nbsp;D. Therefore the figure A&nbsp;B&nbsp;F&nbsp;E will
be equal to the new square, which is to be found, but is not
it self a square, because the side A&nbsp;E is not of the same length
with the side E&nbsp;F. But to find a square equal to the figure
A&nbsp;B&nbsp;F&nbsp;E you must proceed thus. Divide the line D&nbsp;E into two
equal parts in the point G, and to the center G with the interval
G&nbsp;D describe the circle D&nbsp;H&nbsp;E&nbsp;I; then prolong the line A&nbsp;B,
till it meets the circle in K; and make the square A&nbsp;K&nbsp;L&nbsp;M, which
square will be equal to the figure A&nbsp;B&nbsp;F&nbsp;E, and bear to the square
A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D the same proportion, as the line A&nbsp;E bears to A&nbsp;D.</p>

<p>78. <span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> not proceed to the proof of this, having
only here set it down as a specimen of the method of resolving
geometrical problems by the description of straight lines
and circles. But there are some problems, which cannot be
resolved by drawing straight lines or circles upon a plane. For
the management therefore of these they took into consideration
solid figures, and of the solid figures they found that,
which is called a cone, to be the most useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>79. <span class="smcap gesperrt">A cone</span> is thus defined by <span class="smcap">Euclide</span> in his elements
of geometry<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. If to the straight line A&nbsp;B (in fig. 62.)
another straight line, as A&nbsp;C, be drawn perpendicular, and the
two extremities B and C be joined by a third straight line
composing the triangle A&nbsp;C&nbsp;B (for so every figure is called,
which is included under three straight lines) then the two
points A and B being held fixed, as two centers, and the triangle
A&nbsp;C&nbsp;B being turned round upon the line A&nbsp;B, as on an axis;
the line A&nbsp;C will describe a circle, and the figure A&nbsp;C&nbsp;B will
describe a cone, of the form represented by the figure B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F
(fig. 63.) in which the circle C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F is usually called the
base of the cone, and B the vertex.</p>

<p>80. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> by this figure may several problems be resolved,
which cannot by the simple description of straight lines and
circles upon a plane. Suppose for instance, it were required
to make a cube, which should bear any assigned proportion
to some other cube named. I need not here inform my readers,
that a cube is the figure of a dye. This problem was
much celebrated among the ancients, and was once inforced
by the command of an oracle.  This problem may be performed
by a cone thus. First make a cone from a triangle,
whose side A&nbsp;C shall be half the length of the side B&nbsp;C
Then on the plane A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D (fig. 64.) let the line E&nbsp;F be
exhibited equal in length to the side of the cube proposed;
and let the line F&nbsp;G be drawn perpendicular to E&nbsp;F, and of
such a length, that it bear the same proportion to E&nbsp;F, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cube to be sought is required to bear to the cube proposed.
Through the points E, F, and G let the circle F&nbsp;H&nbsp;I be described.
Then let the line E&nbsp;F be prolonged beyond F to K, that F&nbsp;K
be equal to F&nbsp;E, and let the triangle F&nbsp;K&nbsp;L, having all its sides
F&nbsp;K, K&nbsp;L, L&nbsp;F equal to each other, be hung down perpendicularly
from the plane A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D. After this, let another plane
M&nbsp;N&nbsp;O&nbsp;P be extended through the point L, so as to be equidistant
from the former plane A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D, and in this plane let
the line Q&nbsp;L&nbsp;R be drawn so, as to be equidistant from the line
E&nbsp;F&nbsp;K. All this being thus prepared, let such a cone, as was
above directed to be made, be so applied to the plane M&nbsp;N&nbsp;O&nbsp;P,
that it touch this plane upon the line Q&nbsp;R, and that the vertex
of the cone be applied to the point L. This cone, by cutting
through the first plane A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D, will cross the circle F&nbsp;H&nbsp;I before
described. And if from the point S, where the surface
of this cone intersects the circle, the line S&nbsp;T be drawn so, as
to be equidistant from the line E&nbsp;F; the line F&nbsp;T will be equal
to the side of the cube sought: that is, if there be two cubes
or dyes formed, the side of one being equal to E&nbsp;F, and the
side of the other equal to F&nbsp;T; the former of these cubes shall
bear the same proportion to the latter, as the line E&nbsp;F bears
to F&nbsp;G.</p>

<p>81. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Indeed</span> this placing a cone to cut through a plane is
not a practicable method of resolving problems. But when
the geometers had discovered this use of the cone, they applied
themselves to consider the nature of the lines, which
will be produced by the intersection of the surface of a cone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and a plane; whereby they might be enabled both to reduce
these kinds of solutions to practice, and also to render their
demonstrations concise and elegant.</p>

<p><a name="c106" id="c106">82.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Whenever</span> the plane, which cuts the cone, is equidistant
from another plane, that touches the cone on the side;
(which is the case of the present figure;) the line, wherein
the plane cuts the surface of the cone, is called a parabola.
But if the plane, which cuts the cone, be so inclined to this
other, that it will pass quite through the cone (as in fig. 65.)
such a plane by cutting the cone produces the figure called
an ellipsis, in which we shall hereafter shew the earth and
other planets to move round the sun. If the plane, which
cuts the cone, recline the other way (as in fig. 66.) so as not
to be parallel to any plane, whereon the cone can lie, nor yet
to cut quite through the cone; such a plane shall produce in
the cone a third kind of line, which is called an hyperbola.
But it is the first of these lines named the parabola, wherein
bodies, that are thrown obliquely, will be carried by the force
of gravity; as I shall here proceed to shew, after having first
directed my readers how to describe this sort of line upon a
plane, by which the form of it may be seen.</p>

<p>83. <span class="smcap gesperrt">To</span> any straight line A&nbsp;B (fig. 67.) let a straight ruler
C&nbsp;D be so applied, as to stand against it perpendicularly. Upon
the edge of this ruler let another ruler E&nbsp;F be so placed, as to
move along upon the edge of the first ruler C&nbsp;D, and keep always
perpendicular to it. This being so disposed, let any
point, as G, be taken in the line A&nbsp;B, and let a string equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in length to the ruler E&nbsp;F be fastened by one end to the point
G, and by the other to the extremity F of the ruler E&nbsp;F. Then
if the string be held down to the ruler E&nbsp;F by a pin H, as is
represented in the figure; the point of this pin, while the
ruler E&nbsp;F moves on the ruler C&nbsp;D, shall describe the line I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L,
which will be one part of the curve line, whose description
we were here to teach: and by applying the rulers in the like
manner on the other side of the line A&nbsp;B, we may describe
the other part I&nbsp;M of this line. If the distance C&nbsp;G be equal
to half the line E&nbsp;F in fig. 64, the line M&nbsp;I&nbsp;L will be that very
line, wherein the plane A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D in that figure cuts the cone.</p>

<p>84. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> line A&nbsp;I is called the axis of the parabola M&nbsp;I&nbsp;L,
and the point G is called the focus.</p>

<p>85. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> by comparing the effects of gravity upon falling
bodies, with what is demonstrated of this figure by the geometers,
it is proved, that every body thrown obliquely is
carried forward in one of these lines, the axis whereof is perpendicular to the horizon.</p>

<p>86. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> geometers demonstrate, that if a line be drawn to
touch a parabola in any point, as the line A&nbsp;B (in fig. 68.) touches
the parabola C&nbsp;D, whose axis is Y&nbsp;Z, in the point E; and several
lines F&nbsp;G, H&nbsp;I, K&nbsp;L be drawn parallel to the axis of the parabola:
then the line F&nbsp;G will be to H&nbsp;I in the duplicate proportion of
E&nbsp;F to E&nbsp;H, and F&nbsp;G to K&nbsp;L in the duplicate proportion of E&nbsp;F
to E&nbsp;K; likewise H&nbsp;I to K&nbsp;L in the duplicate proportion of E&nbsp;H
to E&nbsp;K. What is to be understood by duplicate or two-fold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
proportion, has been already explained<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. Accordingly I
mean here, that if the line M be taken to bear the same proportion
to E&nbsp;H, as E&nbsp;H bears to E&nbsp;F, H&nbsp;I will bear the same
proportion to F&nbsp;G, as M bears to E&nbsp;F; and if the line N bears
the same proportion to E&nbsp;K, as E&nbsp;K bears to E&nbsp;F, K&nbsp;L will bear
the same proportion to F&nbsp;G, as N bears to E&nbsp;F; or if the line
O bear the same proportion to E&nbsp;K, as E&nbsp;K bears to E&nbsp;H, K&nbsp;L
will bear the same proportion to H&nbsp;I, as O bears to E&nbsp;H.</p>

<p>87. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> property is essential to the parabola, being
so connected with the nature of the figure, that every line
possessing this property is to be called by this name.</p>

<p>88. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> suppose a body to be thrown from the point A
(in fig. 69.) towards B in the direction of the line A&nbsp;B. This
body, if left to it self, would move on with a uniform motion
through this line A&nbsp;B. Suppose the eye of a spectator to
be placed at the point C just under the point A; and let us
imagine the earth to be so put into motion along with the
body, as to carry the spectator’s eye along the line C&nbsp;D parallel
to A&nbsp;B; and that the eye would move on with the same velocity,
wherewith the body would proceed in the line A&nbsp;B, if
it were to be left to move without any disturbance from its
gravitation towards the earth. In this case if the body moved
on without being drawn towards the earth, it would appear
to the spectator to be at rest.  But if the power of gravity
exerted it self on the body, it would appear to the spectator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to fall directly down. Suppose at the distance of time,
wherein the body by its own progressive motion would have
moved from A to E, it should appear to the spectator to
have fallen through a length equal to E&nbsp;F: then the body at
the end of this time will actually have arrived at the point F.
If in the space of time, wherein the body would have moved
by its progressive motion from A to G, it would have appeared
to the spectator to have fallen down the space G&nbsp;H:
then the body at the end of this greater interval of time
will be arrived at the point H. Now if the line A&nbsp;F&nbsp;H&nbsp;I be
that, through which the body actually passes; from what
has here been said, it will follow, that this line is one of those,
which I have been describing under the name of the parabola.
For the distances E&nbsp;F, G&nbsp;H, through which the body is
seen to fall, will increase in the duplicate proportion of the
times<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; but the lines A&nbsp;E, A&nbsp;G will be proportional to the
times wherein they would have been described by the single
progressive motion of the body: therefore the lines E&nbsp;F, G&nbsp;H
will be in the duplicate proportion of the lines A&nbsp;F, A&nbsp;G; and
the line A&nbsp;F&nbsp;H&nbsp;I possesses the property of the parabola.</p>

<p>89. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the earth be not supposed to move along with the
body, the case will be a little different. For the body being
constantly drawn directly towards the center of the earth,
the body in its motion will be drawn in a direction a little oblique
to that, wherein it would be drawn by the earth in motion,
as before supposed. But the distance to the center of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
earth bears so vast a proportion to the greatest length, to which
we can throw bodies, that this obliquity does not merit any
regard. From the sequel of this discourse it may indeed be
collected, what line the body being thrown thus would be
found to describe, allowance being made for this obliquity of
the earth’s action<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. This is the discovery of Sir <span class="smcap">Is. Newton</span>;
but has no use in this place. Here it is abundantly sufficient
to consider the body as moving in a parabola.</p>

<p>90. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> line, which a projected body describes, being
thus known, practical methods have been deduced from
hence for directing the shot of great guns to strike any object
desired. This work was first attempted by <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Galileo</em></span>,
and soon after farther improved by his scholar <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Torricelli</em></span>;
but has lately been rendred more complete by the great
Mr. <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Cotes</em></span>, whose immature death is an unspeakable loss to
mathematical learning. If it be required to throw a body
from the point A (in fig. 70.) so as to strike the point B;
through the points A, B draw the straight line C&nbsp;D, and erect
the line A&nbsp;E perpendicular to the horizon, and of four times
the height, from which a body must fall to acquire the velocity,
wherewith the body is intended to be thrown. Through
the points A and E describe a circle, that shall touch the line
C&nbsp;D in the point A. Then from the point B draw the line
B&nbsp;F perpendicular to the horizon, intersecting the circle in the
points G and H. This being done, if the body be projected
directly towards either of these points G or H, it shall fall upon
the point B; but with this difference, that, if it be thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
in the direction A&nbsp;G, it shall sooner arrive at B, than if it were
projected in the direction A&nbsp;H. When the body is projected
in the direction A&nbsp;G; the time, it will take up in arriving at
B, will bear the same proportion to the time, wherein it would
fall down through one fourth part of A&nbsp;E, as A&nbsp;G bears to
half A&nbsp;E. But when the body is thrown in the direction of
A&nbsp;H, the time of its passing to B will bear the same proportion
to the time, wherein it would fall through one fourth part
of A&nbsp;E, as A&nbsp;H bears to half A&nbsp;E.</p>

<p>91. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the line A&nbsp;I be drawn so as to divide the angle under
E&nbsp;A&nbsp;D in the middle, and the line I&nbsp;K be drawn perpendicular
to the horizon; this line will touch the circle in the
point I, and if the body be thrown in the direction A&nbsp;I, it
will fall upon the point K: and this point K is the farthest
point in the line A&nbsp;D, which the body can be made to strike,
without increasing its velocity.</p>

<p>92. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> velocity, wherewith the body every where
moves, may be found thus. Suppose the body to move in
the parabola A&nbsp;B (fig. 71.) Erect A&nbsp;C perpendicular to the
horizon, and equal to the height, from which a body must
fall to acquire the velocity, wherewith the body sets out from
A. If you take any points as D and E in the parabola, and
draw D&nbsp;F and E&nbsp;G parallel to the horizon; the velocity of the
body in D will be equal to what a body will acquire in falling
down by its own weight through C&nbsp;F, and in E the velocity
will be the same, as would be acquired in falling through
C&nbsp;G. Thus the body moves slowest at the highest point H
of the parabola; and at equal distances from this point will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
move with equal swiftness, and descend from that highest
point through the line H&nbsp;B altogether like to the line A&nbsp;H in
which it ascended; abating only the resistance of the air,
which is not here considered. If the line H&nbsp;I be drawn from
the highest point H parallel to the horizon, A&nbsp;I will be equal
to ¼ of B&nbsp;G in fig. 70, when the body is projected in the direction
A&nbsp;G, and equal to ¼ of B&nbsp;H, when the body is thrown in
the direction A&nbsp;H provided A&nbsp;D be drawn horizontally.</p>

<p><a name="c112" id="c112">93.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> I have recounted the principal discoveries,
which had been made concerning the motion of bodies by
Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em>’s</span> predecessors; all these discoveries, by
being found to agree with experience, contributing to establish
the laws of motion, from whence they were deduced.
I shall therefore here finish what I had to say upon those
laws; and conclude this chapter with a few words concerning
the distinction which ought to be made between absolute
and relative motion. For some have thought fit to confound
them together; because they observe the laws of motion to
take place here on the earth, which is in motion, after the same
manner as if it were at rest. But Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> has
been careful to distinguish between the relative and absolute
consideration both of motion and time<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. The astronomers
anciently found it necessary to make this distinction in time.
Time considered in it self passes on equably without relation to
any thing external, being the proper measure of the continuance
and duration of all things. But it is most frequently conceived
of by us under a relative view to some succession in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
sensible things, of which we take cognizance.  The succession
of the thoughts in our own minds is that, from whence
we receive our first idea of time, but is a very uncertain measure
thereof; for the thoughts of some men flow on much
more swiftly, than the thoughts of others; nor does the same
person think equally quick at all times. The motions of the
heavenly bodies are more regular; and the eminent division
of time into night and day, made by the sun, leads us to
measure our time by the motion of that luminary: nor do we
in the affairs of life concern our selves with any inequality,
which there may be in that motion; but the space of time
which comprehends a day and night is rather supposed to be
always the same.  However astronomers anciently found
these spaces of time not to be always of the same length, and
have taught how to compute their differences.  Now the
time, when so equated as to be rendered perfectly equal, is
the true measure of duration, the other not. And therefore
this latter, which is absolutely true time, differs from the
other, which is only apparent. And as we ordinarily make
no distinction between apparent time, as measured by the
sun, and the true; so we often do not distinguish in our usual
discourse between the real, and the apparent or relative
motion of bodies; but use the same words for one, as we
should for the other.  Though all things about us are really
in motion with the earth; as this motion is not visible, we
speak of the motion of every thing we see, as if our selves
and the earth stood still. And even in other cases, where we
discern the motion of bodies, we often speak of them not in
relation to the whole motion we see, but with regard to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
bodies, to which they are contiguous. If any body were lying
on a table; when that table shall be carried along, we
say the body rests upon the table, or perhaps absolutely, that
the body is at rest. However philosophers must not reject all
distinction between true and apparent motions, any more than
astronomers do the distinction between true and vulgar time;
for there is as real a difference between them, as will appear
by the following consideration. Suppose all the bodies of
the universe to have their courses stopped, and reduced to
perfect rest. Then suppose their present motions to be again
restored; this cannot be done without an actual impression
made upon some of them at least. If any of them be
left untouched, they will retain their former state, that is,
still remain at rest; but the other bodies, which are
wrought upon, will have changed their former state of rest,
for the contrary state of motion. Let us now suppose the
bodies left at rest to be annihilated, this will make no alteration
in the state of the moving bodies; but the effect
of the impression, which was made upon them, will still
subsist. This shews the motion they received to be an absolute
thing, and to have no necessary dependence upon
the relation which the body said to be in motion has to any
other body<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

<p>94. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Besides</span> absolute and relative motion are distinguishable
by their Effects. One effect of motion is, that bodies,
when moved round any center or axis, acquire a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
power, by which they forcibly press themselves from that center
or axis of motion. As when a body is whirled about in a
sling, the body presses against the sling, and is ready to fly
out as soon as liberty is given it. And this power is proportional
to the true, not relative motion of the body round such
a center or axis. Of this Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> gives the following
instance<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. If a pail or such like vessel near full of water
be suspended by a string of sufficient length, and be turned
about till the string be hard twisted. If then as soon as the
vessel and water in it are become still and at rest, the vessel be
nimbly turned about the contrary way the string was twisted,
the vessel by the strings untwisting it self shall continue its motion
a long time. And when the vessel first begins to turn, the
water in it shall receive little or nothing of the motion of the
vessel, but by degrees shall receive a communication of motion,
till at last it shall move round as swiftly as the vessel it
self. Now the definition of motion, which <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Des&nbsp;Cartes</em></span> has
given us upon this principle of making all motion meerly relative,
is this: that motion, is a removal of any body from its
vicinity to other bodies, which were in immediate contact
with it, and are considered as at rest<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. And if this be compared
with what he soon after says, that there is nothing real
or positive in the body moved, for the sake of which we
ascribe motion to it, which is not to be found as well in the
contiguous bodies, which are considered as at rest<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>; it will
follow from thence, that we may consider the vessel as at rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and the water as moving in it: and the water in respect of
the vessel has the greatest motion, when the vessel first begins
to turn, and loses this relative motion more and more, till at
length it quite ceases. But now, when the vessel first begins
to turn, the surface of the water remains smooth and flat, as
before the vessel began to move; but as the motion of the
vessel communicates by degrees motion to the water, the surface
of the water will be observed to change, the water subsiding
in the middle and rising at the edges: which elevation
of the water is caused by the parts of it pressing from the axis,
they move about; and therefore this force of receding from
the axis of motion depends not upon the relative motion of
the water within the vessel, but on its absolute motion; for
it is least, when that relative motion is greatest, and greatest,
when that relative motion is least, or none at all.</p>

<p>95. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> the true cause of what appears in the surface
of this water cannot be assigned, without considering the
water’s motion within the vessel. So also in the system of the
world, in order to find out the cause of the planetary motions,
we must know more of the real motions, which belong
to each planet, than is absolutely necessary for the uses
of astronomy. If the astronomer should suppose the earth to
stand still, he could ascribe such motions to the celestial bodies,
as should answer all the appearances; though he would
not account for them in so simple a manner, as by attributing
motion to the earth. But the motion of the earth must of
necessity be considered, before the real causes, which actuate
the planetary system, can be discovered.</p>

Of CENTRIPETAL FORCES.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04"><span class="gesperrt">WE</span> have just been describing in the preceding chapter
the effects produced on a body in motion, from its
being continually acted upon by a power always equal in
strength, and operating in parallel directions<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. But bodies
may be acted upon by powers, which in different places shall
have different degrees of force, and whose several directions
shall be variously inclined to each other. The most simple
of these in respect to direction is, when the power is
pointed constantly to one center. This is truly the case of
that power, whose effects we described in the foregoing chapter;
though the center of that power is so far removed, that
the subject then before us is most conveniently to be considered
in the light, wherein we have placed it: But Sir <span class="smcap">Isaac
Newton</span> has considered very particularly this other case of
powers, which are constantly directed to the same center. It
is upon this foundation, that all his discoveries in the system
of the world are raised. And therefore, as this subject bears
so very great a share in the philosophy, of which I am discoursing,
I think it proper in this place to take a short view
of some of the general effects of these powers, before we
come to apply them particularly to the system of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> powers or forces are by Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em>
called centripetal; and their first effect is to cause the body, on
which they act, to quit the straight course, wherein it would
proceed if undisturbed, and to describe an incurvated line,
which shall always be bent towards the center of the force.
It is not necessary, that such a power should cause the body
to approach that center. The body may continue to recede
from the center of the power, notwithstanding its being drawn
by the power; but this property must always belong to its
motion, that the line, in which it moves, will continually be
concave towards the center, to which the power is directed.
Suppose A (in fig. 72.) to be the center of a force. Let a
body in B be moving in the direction of the straight line B&nbsp;C,
in which line it would continue to move, if undisturbed; but
being attracted by the centripetal force towards A, the body
must necessarily depart from this line B&nbsp;C, and being drawn
into the curve line B&nbsp;D, must pass between the lines A&nbsp;B and
B&nbsp;C. It is evident therefore, that the body in B being gradually
turned off from the straight line B&nbsp;C, it will at first be
convex toward the line B&nbsp;C, and consequently concave towards
the point A: for these centripetal powers are supposed
to be in strength proportional to the power of gravity, and,
like that, not to be able after the manner of an impulse to turn
the body sensibly out of its course into a different one in an instant,
but to take up some space of time in producing a visible
effect. That the curve will always continue to have its
concavity towards A may thus appear. In the line B&nbsp;C near
to B take any point as E, from which the line E&nbsp;F&nbsp;G may be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
drawn, as to touch the curve line B&nbsp;D in some point as F. Now
when the body is come to F, if the centripetal power were immediately
to be suspended, the body would no longer continue
to move in a curve line, but being left to it self would
forthwith reassume a straight course; and that straight course
would be in the line F&nbsp;G: for that line is in the direction of
the body’s motion at the point F. But the centripetal force
continuing its energy, the body will be gradually drawn from
this line F&nbsp;G so as to keep in the line F&nbsp;D, and make that line
near the point F to be convex toward F&nbsp;G, and concave toward
A. After the same manner the body may be followed on in
its course through the line B&nbsp;D, and every part of that line be
shewn to be concave toward the point A.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> then is the constant character belonging to those
motions, which are carried on by centripetal forces; that the
line, wherein the body moves, is throughout concave towards
the center of the force. In respect to the successive distances
of the body from the center there is no general rule to be laid
down; for the distance of the body from the center may either
increase, or decrease, or even keep always the same. The
point A (in fig. 73.) being the center of a centripetal force,
let a body at B set out in the direction of the straight line B&nbsp;C
perpendicular to the line A&nbsp;B drawn from A to B. It will be
easily conceived, that there is no other point in the line B&nbsp;C so
near to A, as the point B; that A&nbsp;B is the shortest of all the
lines, which can be drawn from A to any part of the line B&nbsp;C;
all other lines, as A&nbsp;D, or A&nbsp;E, drawn from A to the line B&nbsp;C
being longer than A&nbsp;B.  Hence it follows, that the body setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
out from B, if it moved in the line B&nbsp;C, it would recede
more and more from the point A. Now as the operation of
a centripetal force is to draw a body towards the center of
the force: if such a force act upon a resting body, it must
necessarily put that body so into motion, as to cause it to
move towards the center of the force: if the body were of
it self moving towards that center, the centripetal force
would accelerate that motion, and cause it to move faster
down: but if the body were in such a motion, as being left
to itself it would recede from this center, it is not necessary,
that the action of a centripetal power upon it should
immediately compel the body to approach the center, from
which it would otherwise have receded; the centripetal
power is not without effect, if it cause the body to recede
more slowly from that center, than otherwise it would have
done. Thus in the case before us, the smallest centripetal
power, if it act on the body, will force it out of the line B&nbsp;C,
and cause it to pass in a bent line between B&nbsp;C and the point
A, as has been before explained. When the body, for instance,
has advanced to the line A&nbsp;D, the effect of the centripetal
force discovers it self by having removed the body out
of the line B&nbsp;C, and brought it to cross the line A&nbsp;D somewhere
between A and D: suppose at F. Now A&nbsp;D being
longer than A&nbsp;B, A&nbsp;F may also be longer than A&nbsp;B. The centripetal
power may indeed be so strong, that A&nbsp;F shall be
shorter than A&nbsp;B; or it may be so evenly balanced with the
progressive motion of the body, that A&nbsp;F and A&nbsp;B shall be just
equal: and in this last case, when the centripetal force is of
that strength, as constantly to draw the body as much toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the center, as the progressive motion would carry it off, the
body will describe a circle about the center A, this center of
the force being also the center of the circle.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the body, instead of setting out in the line B&nbsp;C perpendicular
to A&nbsp;B, had set out in another line B&nbsp;G more inclined
towards the line A&nbsp;B, moving in the curve line B&nbsp;H;
then as the body, if it were to continue its motion in the line
B&nbsp;G, would for some time approach the center A; the centripetal
force would cause it to make greater advances toward
that center. But if the body were to set out in the line B&nbsp;I reclined
the other way from the perpendicular B&nbsp;C, and were to
be drawn by the centripetal force into the curve line B&nbsp;K; the
body, notwithstanding any centripetal force, would for some
time recede from the center; since some part at least of the
curve line B&nbsp;K lies between the line B&nbsp;I and the perpendicular B&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> far we have explained such effects, as attend
every centripetal force. But as these forces may be very different
in regard to the different degrees of strength, wherewith
they act upon bodies in different places; I shall now proceed
to make mention in general of some of the differences
attending these centripetal motions.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap gesperrt">To</span> reassume the consideration of the last mentioned
case. Suppose a centripetal power directed toward the point
A (in fig. 74.) to act on a body in B, which is moving in
the direction of the straight line B&nbsp;C, the line B&nbsp;C reclining
off from A&nbsp;B. If from A the straight lines A&nbsp;D, A&nbsp;E, A&nbsp;F are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
drawn at pleasure to the line C&nbsp;B; the line C&nbsp;B being prolonged
beyond B to G, it appears that A&nbsp;D is inclined to the line
G&nbsp;C more obliquely, than A&nbsp;B is inclined to it, A&nbsp;E is inclined
more obliquely than A&nbsp;D, and A&nbsp;F more than A&nbsp;E. To
speak more correctly, the angle under A&nbsp;D&nbsp;G is less than that
under A&nbsp;B&nbsp;G, the angle under A&nbsp;E&nbsp;G less than that under
A&nbsp;D&nbsp;G, and the angle under A&nbsp;F&nbsp;G less than that under A&nbsp;E&nbsp;G.
Now suppose the body to move in the curve line B&nbsp;H&nbsp;I&nbsp;K.
Then it is here likewise evident, that the line B&nbsp;H&nbsp;I&nbsp;K being
concave towards A, and convex towards the line B&nbsp;C,
it is more and more turned off from the line B&nbsp;C; so
that in the point H the line A&nbsp;H will be less obliquely inclined
to the curve line B&nbsp;H&nbsp;I&nbsp;K, than the same line A&nbsp;H&nbsp;D is inclined
to B&nbsp;C at the point D; at the point I the inclination of the
line A&nbsp;I to the curve line will be more different from the inclination
of the same line A&nbsp;I&nbsp;E to the line B&nbsp;C, at the point E;
and in the points K and F the difference of inclination will be
still greater; and in both the inclination at the curve will be
less oblique, than at the straight line B&nbsp;C. But the straight
line A&nbsp;B is less obliquely inclined to B&nbsp;G, than A&nbsp;D is inclined
towards D&nbsp;G: therefore although the line A&nbsp;H be less obliquely
inclined towards the curve H&nbsp;B, than the same line A&nbsp;H&nbsp;D is
inclined towards D&nbsp;G; yet it is possible, that the inclination
at H may be more oblique, than the inclination at B. The inclination
at H may indeed be less oblique than the other, or
they may be both the same. This depends upon the degree
of strength, wherewith the centripetal force exerts it self,
during the passage of the body from B to H. After the same
manner the inclinations at I and K depend entirely on the degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of strength, wherewith the centripetal force acts on the
body in its passage from H to K: if the centripetal force be
weak enough, the lines A&nbsp;H and A&nbsp;I drawn from the center A
to the body at H and at I shall be more obliquely inclined to
the curve, than the line A&nbsp;B is inclined towards B&nbsp;G. The centripetal
force may be of that strength as to render all these inclinations
equal, or if stronger, the inclinations at I and K
will be less oblique than at B. Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> has particularly
shewn, that if the centripetal power decreases after
a certain manner with the increase of distance, a body may
describe such a curve line, that all the lines drawn from the
center to the body shall be equally inclined to that curve line.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
But I do not here enter into any particulars, my present intention
being only to shew, that it is possible for a body to be
acted upon by a force continually drawing it down towards a
center, and yet that the body shall continue to recede from
that center; for here as long as the lines A&nbsp;H, A&nbsp;I, &amp;c drawn
from the center A to the body do not become less oblique to
the curve, in which the body moves; so long shall those lines
perpetually increase, and consequently the body shall more
and more recede from the center.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> we may observe farther, that if the centripetal
power, while the body increases its distance from the center,
retain sufficient strength to make the lines drawn from the
center to the body to become at length less oblique to the
curve; then if this diminution of the obliquity continue, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
at last the line drawn from the center to the body shall cease
to be obliquely inclined to the curve, and shall become perpendicular
thereto; from this instant the body shall no longer
recede from the center, but in its following motion it shall
again descend, and shall describe a curve line in all respects
like to that, which it has described already; provided the
centripetal power, every where at the same distance from the
center, acts with the same strength. So we observed in the
preceding chapter, that, when the motion of a projectile became
parallel to the horizon, the projectile no longer ascended,
but forthwith directed its course downwards, descending
in a line altogether like that, wherein it had before ascended<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> return of the body may be proved by the following
proposition: that if the body in any place, suppose at
I, were to be stopt, and be thrown directly backward with the
velocity, wherewith it was moving forward in that point I;
then the body, by the action of the centripetal force upon it,
would move back again over the path I&nbsp;H&nbsp;B, in which it had
before advanced forward, and would arrive again at the point
B in the same space of time, as was taken up in its passage
from B to I; the velocity of the body at its return to the point
B being the same, as that wherewith it first set out from that
point. To give a full demonstration of this proposition,
would require that use of mathematics, which I here purpose
to avoid; but, I believe, it will appear in great measure
evident from the following considerations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Suppose</span> (in fig. 75.) that a body were carried after
the following manner through the bent figure A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F,
composed of the straight lines A&nbsp;B, B&nbsp;C, C&nbsp;D, D&nbsp;E, E&nbsp;F. First
let it be moving in the line A&nbsp;B, from A towards B, with any
uniform velocity. At B let the body receive an impulse directed
toward some point, as G, taken within the concavity
of the figure.  Now whereas this body, when once moving
in the straight line A&nbsp;B, will continue to move on in this line,
so long as it shall be left to it self; but being disturbed at the
point B in its motion by the impulse, which there acts upon
it, it will be turned out of this line A&nbsp;B into some other straight
line, wherein it will afterwards continue to move, as long as it
shall be left to itself. Therefore let this impulse have strength
sufficient to turn the body into the line B&nbsp;C. Then let the
body move on undisturbed from B to C, but at C let it receive
another impulse pointed toward the same point G, and of sufficient
strength to turn the body into the line C&nbsp;D. At D let
a third impulse, directed like the rest to the point G, turn the
body into the line D&nbsp;E. And at E let another impulse, directed
likewise to the point G, turn the body into the line E&nbsp;F.
Now, I say, if the body while moving in the line E&nbsp;F
be stopt, and turned back again in this line with the same
velocity, as that wherewith it was moving forward in this line;
then by the repetition of the former impulse at E the body will
be turned into the line E&nbsp;D, and move in it from E to D with
the same velocity as before it moved with from D to E; by
the repetition of the impulse at D, when the body shall
have returned to that point, it will be turned into the line
D&nbsp;C; and by the repetition of the other impulses at C and B<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the body will be brought back again into the line B&nbsp;A, with
the velocity, wherewith it first moved in that line.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> I prove as follows. Let D&nbsp;E and F&nbsp;E be continued
beyond E. In D&nbsp;E thus continued take at pleasure the
length E&nbsp;H, and let H&nbsp;I be so drawn, as to be equidistant from
the line G&nbsp;E. Then, by what has been written upon the second
law of motion<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>, it follows, that after the impulse on
the body in E it will move through E&nbsp;I in the same time, as
it would have imployed in moving from E to H, with the velocity
which it had in the line D&nbsp;E. In F&nbsp;E prolonged take
E&nbsp;K equal to E&nbsp;I, and draw K&nbsp;L equidistant from G&nbsp;E. Then,
because the body is thrown back in the line F&nbsp;E with the same
velocity as that wherewith it went forward in that line; if,
when the body was returned to E, it were permitted to go
straight on, it would pass through E&nbsp;K in the same time, as it
took up in passing through E&nbsp;I, when it went forward in the
line E&nbsp;F. But, if at the body’s return to the point E, such an
impulse directed toward the point D were to be given it, whereby
it should be turned into the line D&nbsp;E; I say, that the
impulse necessary to produce this effect must be equal to
that, which turned the body out of the line D&nbsp;E into E&nbsp;F;
and that the velocity, with which the body will return into
the line E&nbsp;D, is the same, as that wherewith it before moved
through this line from D to E. Because E&nbsp;K is equal to E&nbsp;I, and
K&nbsp;L and H&nbsp;I, being each equidistant from G&nbsp;E, are by consequence
equidistant from each other; it follows, that the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
triangular figures I&nbsp;E&nbsp;H and K&nbsp;E&nbsp;L are altogether like and equal
to each other. If I were writing to mathematicians, I might
refer them to some proportions in the elements of <span class="smcap">Euclid</span>
for the proof of this<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> but as I do not here address my self to
such, so I think this assertion will be evident enough without
a proof in form; at least I must desire my readers to receive
it as a proposition true in geometry. But these two triangular
figures being altogether like each other and equal; as E&nbsp;K
is equal to E&nbsp;I, so E&nbsp;L is equal to E&nbsp;H, and K&nbsp;L equal to H&nbsp;I.
Now the body after its return to E being turned out of the line
F&nbsp;E into E&nbsp;D by an impulse acting upon it in E, after the manner
above expressed; the body will receive such a velocity by
this impulse, as will carry it through E&nbsp;L in the same time, as it
would have imployed in passing through E&nbsp;K, if it had gone
on in that line undisturbed. And it has already been observed,
that the time, in which the body would pass over E&nbsp;K
with the velocity wherewith it returns, is equal to the time
it took up in going forward from E to I; that is, equal to the
time, in which it would have gone through E&nbsp;H with the velocity,
wherewith it moved from D to E. Therefore the time,
in which the body will pass through E&nbsp;L after its return into
the line E&nbsp;D, is the same, as would have been taken up by
the body in passing through E&nbsp;H with the velocity, wherewith
the body first moved in the line D&nbsp;E. Since therefore
E&nbsp;L and E&nbsp;H are equal, the body returns into the line D&nbsp;E with
the velocity, which it had before in that line. Again I say,
the second impulse in E is equal to the first. By what has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
been said on the second law of motion concerning the effect of
oblique impulses<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, it will be understood, that the impulse in E,
whereby the body was turned out of the line D&nbsp;E into the line
E&nbsp;F, is of such strength, that if the body had been at rest,
when this impulse had acted upon it, this impulse would have
communicated so much motion to the body, as would have
carried it through a length equal to H&nbsp;I, in the time wherein
the body would have passed from E to H, or in the time
wherein it passed from E to I. In the same manner, on the return
of the body, the impulse in E, whereby the body is turned
out of the line F&nbsp;E into E&nbsp;D, is of such strength, that if it
had acted on the body at rest, it would have caused the body
to move through a length equal to K&nbsp;L, in the same time, as
the body would imploy in passing through E&nbsp;K with the velocity,
wherewith it returns in the line F&nbsp;E. Therefore the second
impulse, had it acted on the body at rest, would have
caused it to move through a length equal to K&nbsp;L in the same
space of time, as would be taken up by the body in passing
through a length equal to H&nbsp;I, were the first impulse to act on
the body when at rest. That is, the effects of the first and
second impulse on the body when at rest would be the same;
for K&nbsp;L and H&nbsp;I are equal: consequently the second impulse
is equal to the first.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> if the body be returned through F&nbsp;E with the
velocity, wherewith it moved forward; we have shewn how
by the repetition of the impulse, which acted on it at E, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
body will return again into the line D&nbsp;E with the velocity,
which it had before in that line. By the same process of reasoning
it may be proved, that, when the body is returned
back to D, the impulse, which before acted on the body at
that point, will throw the body into the line D&nbsp;C with the velocity,
which it first had in that line; and the other impulses
being successively repeated, the body will at length be brought
back again into the line B&nbsp;A with the velocity, wherewith it
set out in that line.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> these impulses, by acting over again in an inverted
order all their operation on the body, bring it back again
through the path, in which it had proceeded forward. And
this obtains equally, whatever be the number of the straight
lines, whereof this curve figure is composed. Now by a method
of reasoning, which Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> makes great
use of, and which he introduced into geometry, thereby
greatly inriching that science<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>; we might make a transition
from this figure composed of a number of straight lines to a
figure of one continued curvature, and from a number of separate
impulses repeated at distinct intervals to a continual
centripetal force, and shew, that, because what has been
here advanced holds universally true, whatever be the number
of straight lines, whereof the curve figure A&nbsp;C&nbsp;F is composed,
and howsoever frequently the impulses at the angles of
this figure are repeated; therefore the same will still remain
true, although this figure should be converted into one of a
continued curvature, and these distinct impulses should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
changed into a continual centripetal force. But as the explaining
this method of reasoning is foreign to my present design;
so I hope my readers, after what has been said, will find no
difficulty in receiving the proposition laid down above: that, if
the body, which has moved through the curve line B&nbsp;H&nbsp;I (in fig.
74.) from B to I, when it is come to I, be thrown directly back
with the same velocity as that, wherewith it proceeded forward,
the centripetal force, by acting over again all its operation on
the body, shall bring the body back again in the line I&nbsp;H&nbsp;B:
and as the motion of the body in its course from B to I was every
where in such a manner oblique to the line drawn from the
center to the body, that the centripetal power acted in some
degree against the body’s motion, and gradually diminished it;
so in the return of the body, the centripetal power will every
where draw the body forward, and accelerate its motion by
the same degrees, as before it retarded it.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> being agreed, suppose the body in K to have the
line A&nbsp;K no longer obliquely inclined to its motion. In this case,
if the body be turned back, in the manner we have been considering,
it must be directed back perpendicularly to A&nbsp;K.
But if it had proceeded forward, it would likewise have moved
in a direction perpendicular to A&nbsp;K; consequently, whether
it move from this point K backward or forward, it must
describe the same kind of course. Therefore since by being
turned back it will go over again the line K&nbsp;I&nbsp;H&nbsp;B; if it be permitted
to go forward, the line K&nbsp;L, which it shall describe,
will be altogether similar to the line K&nbsp;H&nbsp;B.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> like manner we may determine the nature of the
motion, if the line, wherein the body sets out, be inclined (as
in fig. 76.) down toward the line B&nbsp;A drawn between the
body and the center. If the centripetal power so much increases
in strength, as the body approaches, that it can bend
the path, in which the body moves, to that degree, as to cause
all the lines as A&nbsp;H, A&nbsp;I, A&nbsp;K to remain no less oblique to the
motion of the body, than A&nbsp;B is oblique to B&nbsp;C; the body
shall continually more and more approach the center. But
if the centripetal power increases in so much less a degree, as
to permit the line drawn from the center to the body, as it accompanies
the body in its motion, at length to become more
and more erect to the curve wherein the body moves, and in
the end, suppose at K, to become perpendicular thereto; from
that time the body shall rise again. This is evident from what
has been said above; because for the very same reason here also
the body shall proceed from the point K to describe a line altogether
similar to the line, in which it has moved from B to K.
Thus, as it was observed of the pendulum in the preceding chapter<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>,
that all the time it approaches towards being perpendicular
to the horizon, it more and more descends; but, as soon as it
is come into that perpendicular situation, it immediately rises
again by the same degrees, as it descended by before: so here
the body more and more approaches the center all the time it
is moving from B to K; but thence forward it rises from the
center again by the same degrees, as it approached by before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> (in fig. 77.) the line B&nbsp;C be perpendicular to A&nbsp;B; then
it has been observed above<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>, that the centripetal power may
be so balanced with the progressive motion of the body, that
the body may keep moving round the center A constantly at
the same distance; as a body does, when whirled about any
point, to which it is tyed by a string. If the centripetal power
be too weak to produce this effect, the motion of the body
will presently become oblique to the line drawn from itself to
the center, after the manner of the first of the two cases,
which we have been considering. If the centripetal power
be stronger, than what is required to carry the body in a circle,
the motion of the body will presently fall in with the second
of the cases, we have been considering.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the centripetal power so change with the change of
distance, that the body, after its motion has become oblique
to the line drawn from itself to the center, shall again become
perpendicular thereto; which we have shewn to be possible
in both the cases treated of above; then the body shall in its
subsequent motion return again to the distance of A&nbsp;B, and
from that distance take a course similar to the former: and
thus, if the body move in a space free from all resistance,
which has been here all along supposed; it shall continue in
a perpetual motion about the center, descending and ascending
alternately therefrom. If the body setting out from B (in
fig. 78.) in the line B&nbsp;C perpendicular to A&nbsp;B, describe the line
B&nbsp;D&nbsp;E, which in D shall be oblique to the line A&nbsp;D, but in E
shall again become erect to A&nbsp;E drawn from the body in E to the
center A; then from this point E the body shall describe the
line E&nbsp;F&nbsp;G altogether like to the line B&nbsp;D&nbsp;E, and at G shall be
at the same distance from A, as it was at B. But likewise the
line A&nbsp;G shall be erect to the body’s motion. Therefore the
body shall proceed to describe from G the line G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I altogether
similar to the line G&nbsp;F&nbsp;E, and at I have the same distance
from the center, as it had at E; and also have the line A&nbsp;I erect
to its motion: so that its following motion must be in the line
I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L similar to I&nbsp;H&nbsp;G, and the distance A&nbsp;L equal to A&nbsp;G. Thus
the body will go on in a perpetual round without ceasing, alternately
inlarging and contracting its distance from the center.</p>

point G will fall on the line B&nbsp;A prolonged beyond A, the
point I on the line A&nbsp;E prolonged beyond A, and the point L
on B: so that the body will describe a line like the curve line
B&nbsp;E&nbsp;G&nbsp;I in fig. 80, in which the opposite points B and G
are equally distant from A, and the opposite points E and I
are also equally distant from the same point A.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> other cases the line described will have a more
complex figure.</p>

<p>20. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> we have endeavoured to shew how a body,
while it is constantly attracted towards a center, may notwithstanding
by its progressive motion keep it self from falling
down to that center; but describe about it an endless circuit,
sometimes approaching toward that center, and at other
times as much receding from the same.</p>

<p>21. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> here we have supposed, that the centripetal power
is of equal strength every where at the same distance from the
center. And this is the case of that centripetal power, which
will hereafter be shewn to be the cause, that keeps the planets
in their courses.  But a body may be kept on in a perpetual
circuit round a center, although the centripetal power have
not this property. Indeed a body may by a centripetal force
be kept moving in any curve line whatever, that shall have its
concavity turned every where towards the center of the force.</p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap gesperrt">To</span> make this evident I shall first propose the case of a
body moving through the incurvated figure A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E (in fig. 81.)
which is composed of the straight lines A&nbsp;B, B&nbsp;C, C&nbsp;D, D&nbsp;E, and
E&nbsp;A; the motion being carried on in the following manner.
Let the body first move in the line A&nbsp;B with any uniform velocity.
When it is arrived at the point B, let it receive an impulse
directed toward any point F taken within the figure;
and let the impulse be of that strength as to turn the body out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of the line A&nbsp;B into the line B&nbsp;C. The body after this impulse,
while left to itself, will continue moving in the line B&nbsp;C.
At C let the body receive another impulse directed towards
the same point F, of such strength, as to turn the body from
the line B&nbsp;C into the line C&nbsp;D. At D let the body by another
impulse, directed likewise to the point F, be turned out of the
line C&nbsp;D into D&nbsp;E. And at E let another impulse, directed toward
the point F, turn the body from the line D&nbsp;E into E&nbsp;A.
Thus we see how a body may be carried through the figure
A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E by certain impulses directed always toward the same
center, only by their acting on the body at proper intervals,
and with due degrees of strength.</p>

<p>23. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> farther, when the body is come to the point A, if
it there receive another impulse directed like the rest toward the
point F, and of such a degree of strength as to turn the body
into the line A&nbsp;B, wherein it first moved; I say that the body
shall return into this line with the same velocity, as it had at first.</p>

<p>24. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Let</span> A&nbsp;B be prolonged beyond B at pleasure, suppose to
G; and from G let G&nbsp;H be drawn, which if produced should
always continue equidistant from B&nbsp;F, or, according to the
more usual phrase, let G&nbsp;H be drawn parallel to B&nbsp;F. Then
it appears, from what has been said upon the second law of
motion<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, that in the time, wherein the body would have moved
from B to G, had it not received a new impulse in B, by the
means of that impulse it will have acquired a velocity, which
will carry it from B to H. After the same manner, if C&nbsp;I be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
taken equal to B&nbsp;H, and I&nbsp;K be drawn equidistant from or parallel
to C&nbsp;F; the body will have moved from C to K with the
velocity, which it has in the line C&nbsp;D, in the same time, as it
would have employed in moving from C to I with the velocity,
it had in the line B&nbsp;C. Therefore since C&nbsp;I and B&nbsp;H are equal,
the body will move through C&nbsp;K in the same time, as it would
have taken up in moving from B to G with the original velocity,
wherewith it moved through the line A&nbsp;B. Again, D&nbsp;L
being taken equal to C&nbsp;K and L&nbsp;M drawn parallel to D&nbsp;F; for
the same reason as before the body will move through D&nbsp;M with
the velocity, which it has in the line D&nbsp;E, in the same time,
as it would imploy in moving through B&nbsp;G with its original velocity.
In the last place, if E&nbsp;N be taken equal to D&nbsp;M, and
N&nbsp;O be drawn parallel to E&nbsp;F; likewise if A&nbsp;P be taken equal
to E&nbsp;O, and P&nbsp;Q be drawn parallel to A&nbsp;F: then the body with
the velocity, wherewith it returns into the line A&nbsp;B, will pass
through A&nbsp;Q in the same time, as it would have imployed in
passing through B&nbsp;G with its original velocity.  Now as all
this follows directly from what has above been delivered, concerning
the effect of oblique impulses impressed upon bodies
in motion; so we must here observe farther, that it can be
proved by geometry, that A&nbsp;Q will always be equal to E&nbsp;G.
The proof of this I am obliged, from the nature of my present
design, to omit; but this geometrical proportion being
granted, it follows, that the body has returned into the line
A&nbsp;B with the velocity, which it had, when it first moved in
that line; for the velocity, with which it returns into the line
A&nbsp;B, will carry it over the line A&nbsp;Q in the same time, as would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
have been taken up in its passing over an equal line B&nbsp;G with
the original velocity.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> we have found, how a body may be carried round
the figure A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E by the action of certain impulses upon it
which should all be pointed toward one center. And we likewise
see, that when the body is brought back again to the
point, whence it first set out; if it there meet with an impulse
sufficient to turn it again into the line, wherein it moved
at first, its original velocity will be again restored; and by
the repetition of the same impulses, the body will be carried
again in the same round. Therefore if these impulses, which
act on the body at the points B, C, D, E, and A, continue always
the same, the body will make round this figure innumerable
revolutions.</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> proof, which we have here made use of, holds the
same in any number of straight lines, whereof the figure A&nbsp;B&nbsp;D
should be composed; and therefore by the method of reasoning
referred to above<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> we are to conclude, that what has here
been said upon this rectilinear figure, will remain true, if this
figure were changed into one of a continued curvature, and
instead of distinct impulses acting by intervals at the angles of
this figure, we had a continual centripetal force. We have
therefore shewn, that a body may be carried round in any
curve figure A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C ( fig. 82.) which shall every where be
concave towards any one point as D, by the continual action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of a centripetal power directed to that point, and when it is
returned to the point, from whence it set out, it shall recover
again the velocity, with which it departed from that point.
It is not indeed always necessary, that it should return again
into its first course; for the curve line may have some such
figure as the line A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D&nbsp;B&nbsp;E in fig. 83. In this curve line,
if the body set out from B in the direction B&nbsp;F, and moved
through the line B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D, till it returned to B; here the body
would not enter again into the line B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D, because the two
parts B&nbsp;D and B&nbsp;C of the curve line make an angle at the point
B: so that the centripetal power, which at the point B could
turn the body from the line B&nbsp;F into the curve, will not be
able to turn the body into the line B&nbsp;C from the direction, in
which it returns to the point B; a forceable impulse must be
given the body in the point B to produce that effect.</p>

<p>27. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> at the point B, whence the body sets out, the curve
line return into it self (as in fig. 82;) then the body, upon
its arrival again at B, may return into its former course,
and thus make an endless circuit about the center of the centripetal
power.</p>

<p>28. <span class="smcap gesperrt">What</span> has here been said, I hope, will in some measure
enable my readers to form a just idea of the nature of
these centripetal motions.</p>

<p>29. <span class="smcap gesperrt">I have</span> not attempted to shew, how to find particularly,
what kind of centripetal force is necessary to carry a body in
any curve line proposed. This is to be deduced from the degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of curvature, which the figure has in each point of it,
and requires a long and complex mathematical reasoning.
However I shall speak a little to the first proportion, which
Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> lays down for this purpose. By this
proposition, when a body is found moving in a curve line, it
may be known, whether the body be kept in its course by a
power always pointed toward the same center; and if it be so,
where that center is placed. The proposition is this: that if
a line be drawn from some fixed point to the body, and remaining
by one extream united to that point, it be carried
round along with the body; then, if the power, whereby
the body is kept in its course, be always pointed to this fixed
point as a center, this line will move over equal spaces in equal
portions of time. Suppose a body were moving through the
curve line A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D (in fig. 84.) and passed over the arches A&nbsp;B,
B&nbsp;C, C&nbsp;D in equal portions of time; then if a point, as E, can
be found, from whence the line E&nbsp;A being drawn to the body
in A, and accompanying the body in its motion, it shall make
the spaces E&nbsp;A&nbsp;B, E&nbsp;B&nbsp;C, and E&nbsp;C&nbsp;D equal, over which it passes,
while the body describes the arches A&nbsp;B, B&nbsp;C, and C&nbsp;D:
and if this hold the same in all other arches, both great and
small, of the curve line A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D, that these spaces are always
equal, where the times are equal; then is the body kept in
this line by a power always pointed to E as a center.</p>

<p>30. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> principle, upon which Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> has
demonstrated this, requires but small skill in geometry to comprehend.
I shall therefore take the liberty to close the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
chapter with an explication of it; because such an example
will give the clearest notion of our author’s method of applying
mathematical reasoning to these philosophical subjects.</p>

<p>31. <span class="smcap gesperrt">He</span> reasons thus. Suppose a body set out from the point
A (in fig. 85.) to move in the straight line A&nbsp;B; and after it
had moved for some time in that line, it were to receive an
impulse directed to some point as C. Let it receive that impulse
at D; and thereby be turned into the line D&nbsp;E; and let
the body after this impulse take the same length of time in
passing from D to E, as it imployed in the passing from A to
D. Then the straight lines C&nbsp;A, C&nbsp;D, and C&nbsp;E being drawn,
Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> proves, that the and triangular spaces
C&nbsp;A&nbsp;D and C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E are equal. This he does in the following
manner.</p>

<p>32. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Let</span> E&nbsp;F be drawn parallel to C&nbsp;D. Then, from what has
been said upon the second law of motion<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>, it is evident, that
since the body was moving in the line A&nbsp;B, when it received
the impulse in the direction D&nbsp;C; it will have moved after
that impulse through the line D&nbsp;E in the same time, as it would
have taken up in moving through D&nbsp;F, provided it had received
no disturbance in D. But the time of the body’s moving
from D to E is supposed to be equal to the time of its moving
through A&nbsp;D; therefore the time, which the body would
have imployed in moving through D&nbsp;F, had it not been disturbed
in D, is equal to the time, wherein it moved through
A&nbsp;D: consequently D&nbsp;F is equal in length to A&nbsp;D; for if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
body had gone on to move through the line A&nbsp;B without interruption,
it would have moved through all parts thereof
with the same velocity, and have passed over equal parts of
that line in equal portions of time. Now C&nbsp;F being drawn,
since A&nbsp;D and D&nbsp;F are equal, the triangular space C&nbsp;D&nbsp;F is equal
to the triangular space C&nbsp;A&nbsp;D. Farther, the line E&nbsp;F being
parallel to C&nbsp;D, it is proved by <span class="smcap">Euclid</span>, that the triangle
C&nbsp;E&nbsp;D is equal to the triangle C&nbsp;F&nbsp;D<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>: therefore the triangle
C&nbsp;E&nbsp;D is equal to the triangle C&nbsp;A&nbsp;D.</p>

<p>33. <span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> the same manner, if the body receive at E another
impulse directed toward the point C, and be turned by
that impulse into the line E&nbsp;G; if it move afterwards from E to
G in the same space of time, as was taken up by its motion from
D to E, or from A to D; then C&nbsp;G being drawn, the triangle
C&nbsp;E&nbsp;G is equal to C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E. A third impulse at G directed as the
two former to C, whereby the body shall be turned into the
line G&nbsp;H, will have also the like effect with the rest. If the
body move over G&nbsp;H in the same time, as it took up in moving
over E&nbsp;G, the triangle C&nbsp;G&nbsp;H will be equal to the triangle
C&nbsp;E&nbsp;G. Lastly, if the body at H be turned by a fresh impulse
directed toward C into the line H&nbsp;I, and at I by another impulse
directed also to C be turned into the line I&nbsp;K; and if the
body move over each of the lines H&nbsp;I, and I&nbsp;K in the same
time, as it imployed in moving over each of the preceding
lines A&nbsp;D, D&nbsp;E, E&nbsp;G, and G&nbsp;H: then each of the triangles
C&nbsp;H&nbsp;I, and C&nbsp;I&nbsp;K will be equal to each of the preceding. Likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
as the time, in which the body moves over A&nbsp;D&nbsp;E, is
equal to the time of its moving over E&nbsp;G&nbsp;H, and to the time
of its moving over H&nbsp;I&nbsp;K; the space C&nbsp;A&nbsp;D&nbsp;E will be equal to
the space C&nbsp;E&nbsp;G&nbsp;H, and to the space C&nbsp;H&nbsp;I&nbsp;K. In the same
manner as the time, in which the body moved over A&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;G
is equal to the time of its moving over G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I&nbsp;K, so the space
C&nbsp;A&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;G will be equal to the space C&nbsp;G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I&nbsp;K.</p>

<p>34. <span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> this principle Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> demonstrates
the proposition mentioned above, by that method of arguing
introduced by him into geometry, whereof we have before
taken notice<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, by making according to the principles of that
method a transition from this incurvated figure composed of
straight lines, to a figure of continued curvature; and by
shewing, that since equal spaces are described in equal times
in this present figure composed of straight lines, the same relation
between the spaces described and the times of their description
will also have place in a figure of one continued
curvature. He also deduces from this proposition the reverse
of it; and proves, that whenever equal spaces are continually
described; the body is acted upon by a centripetal force
directed to the center, at which the spaces terminate.</p>

Of the RESISTANCE of FLUIDS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap06"><span class="gesperrt">BEFORE</span> the cause can be discovered, which keeps the
planets in motion, it is necessary first to know, whether
the space, wherein they move, is empty and void, or filled
with any quantity of matter. It has been a prevailing
opinion, that all space contains in it matter of some kind or
other; so that where no sensible matter is found, there was
yet a subtle fluid substance by which the space was filled up;
even so as to make an absolute plenitude. In order to examine
this opinion, Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> has largely considered
the effects of fluids upon bodies moving in them.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> effects he has reduced under these three heads.
In the first place he shews how to determine in what manner
the resistance, which bodies suffer, when moving in a fluid,
gradually increases in proportion to the space, they describe
in any fluid; to the velocity, with which they describe it;
and to the time they have been in motion. Under the second
head he considers what degree of resistance different
bodies moving in the same fluid undergo, according to the
different proportion between the density of the fluid and the
density of the body. The densities of bodies, whether fluid
or solid, are measured by the quantity of matter, which is
comprehended under the same magnitude; that body being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the most dense or compact, which under the same bulk contains
the greatest quantity of solid matter, or which weighs
most, the weight of every body being observed above to be
proportional to the quantity of matter in it<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. Thus water is
more dense than cork or wood, iron more dense than water,
and gold than iron. The third particular Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Is. Newton</em></span>
considers concerning the resistance of fluids is the influence,
which the diversity of figure in the resisted body has upon its
resistance.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap gesperrt">For</span> the more perfect illustration of the first of these
heads, he distinctly shews the relation between all the particulars
specified upon three different suppositions. The first
is, that the same body be resisted more or less in the simple
proportion to its velocity; so that if its velocity be doubled,
its resistance shall become threefold. The second is of the
resistance increasing in the duplicate proportion of the velocity;
so that, if the velocity of a body be doubled, its resistance
shall be rendered four times; and if the velocity be
trebled, nine times as great as at first. But what is to be understood
by duplicate proportion has been already explained<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.
The third supposition is, that the resistance increases
partly in the single proportion of the velocity, and partly in
the duplicate proportion thereof.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> all these suppositions, bodies are considered under
two respects, either as moving, and opposing themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
against the fluid by that power alone, which is essential to
them, of resisting to the change of their state from rest to
motion, or from motion to rest, which we have above called
their power of inactivity; or else, as descending or ascending,
and so having the power of gravity combined with
that other power. Thus our author has shewn in all those
three suppositions, in what manner bodies are resisted in an
uniform fluid, when they move with the aforesaid progressive
motion<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>; and what the resistance is, when they ascend or
descend perpendicularly<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. And if a body ascend or descend
obliquely, and the resistance be singly proportional to the velocity,
it is shewn how the body is resisted in a fluid of an uniform
density, and what line it will describe<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, which is determined
by the measurement of the hyperbola, and appears
to be no other than that line, first considered in particular
by Dr. <span class="smcap gesperrt"><em class="gesperrt">Barrow</em></span><a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>, which is now commonly known
by the name of the logarithmical curve. In the supposition
that the resistance increases in the duplicate proportion
of the velocity, our author has not given us the line
which would be described in an uniform fluid; but has instead
thereof discussed a problem, which is in some sort the
reverse; to find the density of the fluid at all altitudes, by
which any given curve line may be described; which problem
is so treated by him, as to be applicable to any kind of
resistance whatever<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. But here not unmindful of practice,
he shews that a body in a fluid of uniform density, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
air, will describe a line, which approaches towards an hyperbola;
that is, its motion will be nearer to that curve line
than to the parabola. And consequent upon this remark, he
shews how to determine this hyperbola by experiment, and
briefly resolves the chief of those problems relating to projectiles,
which are in use in the art of gunnery, in this curve<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>;
as <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Torricelli</em></span> and others have done in the parabola<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>,
whose inventions have been explained at large above<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> author has also handled distinctly that particular
sort of motion, which is described by pendulums<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>; and
has likewise considered some few cases of bodies moving in
resisting fluids round a center, to which they are impelled by
a centripetal force, in order to give an idea of those kinds of
motions<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> treating of the resistance of pendulums has given
him an opportunity of inserting into another part of
his work some speculations upon the motions of them without
resistance, which have a very peculiar elegance; where
in he treats of them as moved by a gravitation acting in
the law, which he shews to belong to the earth below its
surface<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>; performing in this kind of gravitation, where the
force is proportional to the distance from the center, all that
<span class="smcap">Huygens</span> had before done in the common supposition of
its being uniform, and acting in parallel lines<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Huygens</span> at the end of his treatise of the cause of
gravity<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> informs us, that he likewise had carried his speculations
on the first of these suppositions, of the resistance in
fluids being proportional to the velocity of the body, as far as
our author.  But finding by experiment that the second was
more conformable to nature, he afterwards made some progress
in that, till he was stopt, by not being able to execute to his
wish what related to the perpendicular descent of bodies; not
observing that the measurement of the curve line, he made
use of to explain it by, depended on the hyperbola. Which
oversight may well be pardoned in that great man, considering
that our author had not been pleased at that time to
communicate to the publick his admirable discourse of the
<span class="smcap">quadrature</span> or <span class="smcap">measurement of curve lines</span>, with which he
has since obliged the world: for without the use of that
treatise, it is I think no injury even to our author’s unparalleled
abilities to believe, it would not have been easy for
himself to have succeeded so happily in this and many other
parts of his writings.</p>

<p><a name="c147" id="c147">8.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">What Huygens</span> found by experiment, that bodies
were in reality resisted in the duplicate proportion of their velocity,
agrees with the reasoning of our author<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>, who distinguishes
the resistance, which fluids give to bodies by the tenacity
of their parts, and the friction between them and the body,
from that, which arises from the power of inactivity, with
which the constituent particles of fluids are endued like all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
other portions of matter, by which power the particles of fluids
like other bodies make resistance against being put into motion.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> resistance, which arises from the friction of the
body against the parts of the fluid, must be very inconsiderable;
and the resistance, which follows from the tenacity of
the parts of fluids, is not usually very great, and does not
depend much upon the velocity of the body in the fluid;
for as the parts of the fluid adhere together with a certain
degree of force, the resistance, which the body receives from
thence, cannot much depend upon the velocity, with which
the body moves; but like the power of gravity, its effect must
be proportional to the time of its acting. This the reader
may find farther explained by Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> himself
in the postscript to a discourse published by me in <span class="smcap">the philosophical
transactions</span>, N<sup>o</sup> 371. The principal resistance,
which most fluids give to bodies, arises from the power of
inactivity in the parts of the fluids, and this depends upon the
velocity, with which the body moves, on a double account.
In the first place, the quantity of the fluid moved out of
place by the moving body in any determinate space of time
is proportional to the velocity, wherewith the body moves;
and in the next place, the velocity with which each particle of
the fluid is moved, will also be proportional to the velocity of
the body: therefore since the resistance, which any body makes
against being put into motion, is proportional both to the quantity
of matter moved and the velocity it is moved with; the
resistance, which a fluid gives on this account, will be doubly increased
with the increase of the velocity in the moving body;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
that is, the resistance will be in a two-fold or duplicate proportion
of the velocity, wherewith the body moves through the
fluid.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Farther</span> it is most manifest, that this latter kind
of resistance increasing with the increase of velocity, even
in a greater degree than the velocity it self increases, the
swifter the body moves, the less proportion the other species
of resistance will bear to this: nay that this part of the resistance
may be so much augmented by a due increase of velocity,
till the former resistances shall bear a less proportion to
this, than any that might be assigned.  And indeed experience
shews, that no other resistance, than what arises from
the power of inactivity in the parts of the fluid, is of moment,
when the body moves with any considerable swiftness.</p>

<p><a name="c149" id="c149">11.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> is besides these yet another species of resistance,
found only in such fluids, as, like our air, are elastic.
Elasticity belongs to no fluid known to us beside the air. By
this property any quantity of air may be contracted into a
less space by a forcible pressure, and as soon as the compressing
power is removed, it will spring out again to its
former dimensions. The air we breath is held to its present
density by the weight of the air above us.  And as this incumbent
weight, by the motion of the winds, or other causes,
is frequently varied (which appears by the barometer;)
so when this weight is greatest, we breath a more dense air
than at other times. To what degree the air would expand
it self by its spring, if all pressure were removed, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
known, nor yet into how narrow a compass it is capable
of being compressed. Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyle</span> found it by experiment
capable both of expansion and compression to such a degree,
that he could cause a quantity of air to expand it self over a
space some hundred thousand times greater, than the space to
which he could confine the same quantity<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. But I shall
treat more fully of this spring in the air hereafter<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. I am
now only to consider what resistance to the motion of bodies
arises from it.</p>

<p><a name="c150" id="c150">12.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> before our author shews in what manner this
cause of resistance operates, he proposes a method, by which
fluids may be rendered elastic, demonstrating that if their
particles be provided with a power of repelling each other,
which shall exert it self with degrees of strength reciprocally
proportional to the distances between the centers of
the particles; that then such fluids will observe the same
rule in being compressed, as our air does, which is this, that
the space, into which it yields upon compression, is reciprocally
proportional to the compressing weight<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. The term
reciprocally proportional has been explained above<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. And if
the centrifugal force of the particles acted by other laws, such
fluids would yield in a different manner to compression<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Whether</span> the particles of the air be endued with
such a power, by which they can act upon each other out
of contact, our author does not determine, but leaves that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to future examination, and to be discussed by philosophers.
Only he takes occasion from hence to consider the resistance
in elastic fluids, under this notion; making remarks, as
he passes along, upon the differences, which will arise, if their
elasticity be derived from any other fountain<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. And this, I
think, must be confessed to be done by him with great judgment;
for this is far the most reasonable account, which has
been given of this surprizing power, as must without doubt be
freely acknowledged by any one, who in the least considers
the insufficiency of all the other conjectures, which have
been framed; and also how little reason there is to deny to
bodies other powers, by which they may act upon each other
at a distance, as well as that of gravity; which we shall hereafter
shew to be a property universally belonging to all the
bodies of the universe, and to all their parts<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. Nay we actually
find in the loadstone a very apparent repelling, as well as
an attractive power. But of this more in the conclusion of
this discourse.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> these steps our author leads the way to explain
the resistance, which the air and such like fluids will give
to bodies by their elasticity; which resistance he explains
thus. If the elastic power of the fluid were to be varied
so, as to be always in the duplicate proportion of the
velocity of the resisted body, it is shewn that then the
resistance derived from the elasticity, would increase in the
duplicate proportion of the velocity; in so much that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
whole resistance would be in that proportion, excepting only
that small part, which arises from the friction between the
body and the parts of the fluid. From whence it follows,
that because the elastic power of the same fluid does in
truth continue the same, if the velocity of the moving body be
diminished, the resistance from the elasticity, and therefore
the whole resistance, will decrease in a less proportion, than the
duplicate of the velocity; and if the velocity be increased, the
resistance from the elasticity will increase in a less proportion,
than the duplicate of the velocity, that is in a less proportion,
than the resistance made by the power of inactivity of the
parts of the fluid. And from this foundation is raised the proof
of a property of this resistance, given by the elasticity in common
with the others from the tenacity and friction of the
parts of the fluid; that the velocity may be increased, till this
resistance from the fluid’s elasticity shall bear no considerable
proportion to that, which is produced by the power of inactivity
thereof<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. From whence our author draws this conclusion;
that the resistance of a body, which moves very swiftly
in an elastic fluid, is near the same, as if the fluid were
not elastic; provided the elasticity arises from the centrifugal
power of the parts of the medium, as before explained, especially
if the velocity be so great, that this centrifugal power
shall want time to exert it self<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. But it is to be observed,
that in the proof of all this our author proceeds upon the supposition
of this centrifugal power in the parts of the fluid; but
if the elasticity be caused by the expansion of the parts in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
manner of wool compressed, and such like bodies, by which
the parts of the fluid will be in some measure entangled
together, and their motion be obstructed, the fluid will
be in a manner tenacious, and give a resistance upon that account
over and above what depends upon its elasticity only<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>;
and the resistance derived from that cause is to be
judged of in the manner before set down.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is now time to pass to the second part of this theory;
which is to assign the measure of resistance, according
to the proportion between the density of the body and the
density of the fluid. What is here to be understood by the
word density has been explained above<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. For this purpose
as our author before considered two distinct cases of bodies
moving in mediums; one when they opposed themselves to
the fluid by their power of inactivity only, and another
when by ascending or descending their weight was combined
with that other power: so likewise, the fluids themselves
are to be regarded under a double capacity; either
as having their parts at rest, and disposed freely without restraint,
or as being compressed together by their own
weight, or any other cause.</p>

<p><a name="c153" id="c153">16.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the first case, if the parts of the fluid be wholly
disingaged from one another, so that each particle is at liberty
to move all ways without any impediment, it is shewn,
that if a globe move in such a fluid, and the globe and particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of the fluid are endued with perfect elasticity; so that
as the globe impinges upon the particles of it, they shall
bound off and separate themselves from the globe, with the
same velocity, with which the globe strikes upon them; then
the resistance, which the globe moving with any known velocity
suffers, is to be thus determined. From the velocity
of the globe, the time, wherein it would move over two
third parts of its own diameter with that velocity, will be
known. And such proportion as the density of the fluid bears
to the density of the globe, the same the resistance given to
the globe will bear to the force, which acting, like the power
of gravity, on the globe without intermission during the space
of time now mentioned, would generate in the globe the
same degree of motion, as that wherewith it moves in the
fluid<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. But if neither the globe nor the particles of the
fluid be elastic, so that the particles, when the globe
strikes against them, do not rebound from it, then the
resistance will be but half so much<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. Again, if the particles
of the fluid and the globe are imperfectly elastic, so
that the particles will spring from the globe with part only
of that velocity wherewith the globe impinges upon them;
then the resistance will be a mean between the two preceding
cases, approaching nearer to the first or second, according
as the elasticity is more or less<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.</p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> elasticity, which is here ascribed to the particles
of the fluid, is not that power of repelling one another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
when out of contact, by which, as has before been mentioned,
the whole fluid may be rendred elastic; but such
an elasticity only, as many solid bodies have of recovering
their figure, whenever any forcible change is made in it, by
the impulse of another body or otherwise. Which elasticity
has been explained above at large<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c155a" id="c155a">18.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> is the case of discontinued fluids, where the body,
by pressing against their particles, drives them before
itself, while the space behind the body is left empty. But
in fluids which are compressed, so that the parts of them removed
out of place by the body resisted immediately retire
behind the body, and fill that space, which in the other case
is left vacant, the resistance is still less; for a globe in such a
fluid which shall be free from all elasticity, will be resisted
but half as much as the least resistance in the former case<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.
But by elasticity I now mean that power, which renders the
whole fluid so; of which if the compressed fluid be possessed,
in the manner of the air, then the resistance will be greater
than by the foregoing rule; for the fluid being capable in some
degree of condensation, it will resemble so far the case of uncompressed
fluids<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. But, as has been before related, this difference
is most considerable in slow motions.</p>

<p><a name="c155b" id="c155b">19.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the next place our author is particular in determining
the degrees of resistance accompanying bodies of
different figures; which is the last of the three heads, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
divided the whole discourse of resistance into. And in this
disquisition he finds a very surprizing and unthought of difference,
between free and compressed fluids. He proves,
that in the former kind, a globe suffers but half the resistance,
which the cylinder, that circumscribes the globe, will
do, if it move in the direction of its axis<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. But in the latter
he proves, that the globe and cylinder are resisted alike<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.
And in general, that let the shape of bodies be
ever so different, yet if the greatest sections of the bodies
perpendicular to the axis of their motion be equal, the
bodies will be resisted equally<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<p>20. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Pursuant</span> to the difference found between the resistance
of the globe and cylinder in rare and uncompressed
fluids, our author gives us the result of some other inquiries
of the same nature. Thus of all the frustums of a cone,
that can be described upon the same base and with the same
altitude, he shews how to find that, which of all others
will be the least resisted, when moving in the direction of
its axis<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. And from hence he draws an easy method of altering
the figure of any spheroidical solid, so that its capacity
may be enlarged, and yet the resistance of it diminished<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>:
a note which he thinks may not be useless to ship-wrights.
He concludes with determining the solid, which
will be resisted the least that is possible, in these discontinued
fluids<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>21. <span class="smcap gesperrt">That</span> I may here be understood by readers unacquainted
with mathematical terms, I shall explain what I
mean by a frustum of a cone, and a spheroidical solid. A
cone has been defined above. A frustum is what remains,
when part of the cone next the vertex is cut away by a section
parallel to the base of the cone, as in fig. 86. A spheroid
is produced from an ellipsis, as a sphere or globe is made
from a circle. If a circle turn round on its diameter, it describes
by its motion a sphere; so if an ellipsis (which figure
has been defined above, and will be more fully explained
hereafter<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>) be turned round either upon the longest or
shortest line, that can be drawn through the middle of it,
there will be described a kind of oblong or flat sphere, as
in fig. 87. Both these figures are called spheroids, and any
solid resembling these I here call spheroidical.</p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> it should be asked, how the method of altering
spheroidical bodies, here mentioned, can contribute to the
facilitating a ship’s motion, when I just above affirmed,
that the figure of bodies, which move in a compressed
fluid not elastic, has no relation to the augmentation or diminution
of the resistance; the reply is, that what was
there spoken relates to bodies deep immerged into such fluids,
but not of those, which swim upon the surface of them;
for in this latter case the fluid, by the appulse of the anterior
parts of the body, is raised above the level of the
surface, and behind the body is sunk somewhat below; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that by this inequality in the superficies of the fluid, that
part of it, which at the head of the body is higher than
the fluid behind, will resist in some measure after the
manner of discontinued fluids<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>, analogous to what was before
observed to happen in the air through its elasticity,
though the body be surrounded on every side by it<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. And
as far as the power of these causes extends, the figure of the
moving body affects its resistance; for it is evident, that the
figure, which presses least directly against the parts of the fluid,
and so raises least the surface of a fluid not elastic, and least
compresses one that is elastic, will be least resisted.</p>

<p>23. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> way of collecting the difference of the resistance
in rare fluids, which arises from the diversity of figure, is
by considering the different effect of the particles of the fluid
upon the body moving against them, according to the different
obliquity of the several parts of the body upon which
they respectively strike; as it is known, that any body impinging
against a plane obliquely, strikes with a less force,
than if it fell upon it perpendicularly; and the greater the
obliquity is, the weaker is the force. And it is the same
thing, if the body be at rest, and the plane move against it<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c158" id="c158">24.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">That</span> there is no connexion between the figure
of a body and its resistance in compressed fluids, is proved
thus. Suppose A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D (in fig. 88.) to be a canal, having such a
fluid, water for instance, running through it with an equable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
velocity; and let any body E, by being placed in the axis
of the canal, hinder the passage of the water. It is evident,
that the figure of the fore part of this body will
have little influence in obstructing the water’s motion, but
the whole impediment will arise from the space taken up
by the body, by which it diminishes the bore of the canal,
and straightens the passage of the water<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>. But proportional
to the obstruction of the water’s motion, will be
the force of the water upon the body E<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. Now suppose
both orifices of the canal to be closed, and the water in it
to remain at rest; the body E to move, so that the parts
of the water may pass by it with the same degree of velocity,
as they did before; it is beyond contradiction, that the pressure
of the water upon the body, that is, the resistance
it gives to its motion, will remain the same; and therefore
will have little connexion with the figure of the body<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> a method of reasoning drawn from the same fountain
is determined the measure of resistance these compressed
fluids give to bodies, in reference to the proportion between
the density of the body and that of the fluid. This shall be
explained particularly in my comment on Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Is. Newton</em></span>’s
mathematical principles of natural philosophy; but is not a
proper subject to be insisted on farther in this place.</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> have now gone through all the parts of this
theory. There remains nothing more, but in few words to
mention the experiments, which our author has made, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
with bodies falling perpendicularly through water, and the
air<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>, and with pendulums<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>: all which agree with the theory.
In the case of falling bodies, the times of their fall determined
by the theory come out the same, as by observation, to a
surprizing exactness; in the pendulums, the rod, by which
the ball of the pendulum hangs, suffers resistance as well as
the ball, and the motion of the ball being reciprocal, it communicates
such a motion to the fluid, as increases the resistance,
but the deviation from the theory is no more, than
what may reasonably follow from these causes.</p>

<p>27. <span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> this theory of the resistance of fluids, and these experiments,
our author decides the question so long agitated
among natural philosophers, whether all space is absolutely
full of matter. The Aristotelians and Cartesians both assert
this plenitude; the Atomists have maintained the contrary.
Our author has chose to determine this question by his theory
of resistance, as shall be explained in the following chapter.</p>

<p class="cap09">I HAVE now gone through the
first part of my design, and have explained,
as far as the nature of my
undertaking would permit, what
Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> has delivered
in general concerning the motion
of bodies. It follows now to speak
of the discoveries, he has made in the system of the world;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and to shew from him what cause keeps the heavenly bodies
in their courses. But it will be necessary for the use of
such, as are not skilled in astronomy, to premise a brief description
of the planetary system.</p>

<p><a name="c162" id="c162">2.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> system is disposed in the following manner. In
the middle is placed the sun. About him six globes continually
roll. These are the primary planets; that which
is nearest to the sun is called Mercury, the next Venus,
next to this is our earth, the next beyond is Mars, after
him Jupiter, and the outermost of all Saturn. Besides these
there are discovered in this system ten other bodies, which
move about some of these primary planets in the same
manner, as they move round the sun.  These are called
secondary planets.  The most conspicuous of them is the
moon, which moves round our earth; four bodies move in
like manner round Jupiter; and five round Saturn. Those
which move about Jupiter and Saturn, are usually called
satellites; and cannot any of them be seen without a telescope.
It is not impossible, but there may be more secondary
planets, beside these; though our instruments
have not yet discovered any other.  This disposition of
the planetary or solar system is represented in fig. 89.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> same planet is not always equally distant from
the sun. But the middle distance of Mercury is between
⅕ and ⅖ of the distance of the earth from the sun; Venus
is distant from the sun almost ¾ of the distance of the
earth; the middle distance of Mars is something more than
half as much again, as the distance of the earth; Jupiter’s
middle distance exceeds five times the distance of the
earth, by between ⅕ and 1/6 part of this distance; Saturn’s
middle distance is scarce more than 9½ times the distance
between the earth and sun; but the middle distance between
the earth and sun is about 217⅛ times the sun’s semidiameter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">All</span> these planets move one way, from west to
east; and of the primary planets the most remote is longest
in finishing its course round the sun. The period
of Saturn falls short only sixteen days of 29 years and
a half. The period of Jupiter is twelve years wanting about
50 days. The period of Mars falls short of two years
by about 43 days. The revolution of the earth constitutes
the year. Venus performs her period in about 224½ days,
and Mercury in about 88 days.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> course of each planet lies throughout in one
plane or flat surface, in which the sun is placed; but they do
not all move in the same plane, though the different planes,
in which they move, cross each other in very small angles.
They all cross each other in lines, which pass through the
sun; because the sun lies in the plane of each orbit. This
inclination of the several orbits to each other is represented in
fig. 90. The line, in which the plane of any orbit crosses
the plane of the earth’s motion, is called the line of the nodes
of that orbit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Each</span> planet moves round the sun in the line, which
we have mentioned above<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> under the name of ellipsis; which
I shall here shew more particularly how to describe. I have
there said how it is produced in the cone. I shall now shew
how to form it upon a plane. Fix upon any plane two pins,
as at A and B in fig. 91. To these tye a string A&nbsp;C&nbsp;B of any
length. Then apply a third pin D so to the string, as to hold
it strained; and in that manner carrying this pin about, the
point of it will describe an ellipsis. If through the points A,
B the straight line E&nbsp;A&nbsp;B&nbsp;F be drawn, to be terminated at
the ellipsis in the points E and F, this is the longest line
of any, that can be drawn within the figure, and is called
the greater axis of the ellipsis. The line G&nbsp;H, drawn
perpendicular to this axis E&nbsp;F, so as to pass through the
middle of it, is called the lesser axis. The two points A
and B are called focus’s. Now each planet moves round
the sun in a line of this kind, so that the sun is found in
one focus. Suppose A to be the place of the sun. Then E
is the point, wherein the planet will be nearest of all to the
sun, and at F it will be most remote. The point E is called
the perihelion of the planet, and F the aphelion. In G
and H the planet is said to be in its middle or mean distance;
because the distance A&nbsp;G or A&nbsp;H is truly the middle between
A&nbsp;E the least, and A&nbsp;F the greatest distance. In fig. 92.
is represented how the greater axis of each orbit is situated in
respect of the rest. The proportion between the greatest and
least distances of the planet from the sun is very different
in the different planets.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>In Saturn the proportion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>greatest distance to the least is something less, than the proportion
of 9 to 8, but much nearer to this, than to the proportion
of 10 to 9. In Jupiter this proportion is a little greater,
than that of 11 to 10. In Mars it exceeds the proportion of
6 to 5. In the earth it is about the proportion of 30 to 29.
In Venus it is near to that of 70 to 69. And in Mercury it
comes not a great deal short of the proportion of 3 to 2.</p>

<div class="floatright">

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Each</span> of these planets so moves through its ellipsis, that
the line drawn from the sun to the planet, by accompanying
the planet in its motion, will describe about the sun equal spaces
in equal times, after the manner spoke of in the chapter of
centripetal forces<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. There is also a certain relation between
the greater axis’s of these ellipsis’s, and the times, in which
the planets perform their revolutions through them.  Which
relation may be expressed thus. Let the period
of one planet be denoted by the letter A, the
greater axis of its orbit by D; let the period
of another planet be denoted by B, and the
greater axis of this planet’s orbit by E.  Then
if C be taken to bear the same proportion to B,
as B bears to A; likewise if F be taken to bear the same proportion
to E, as E bears to D; and G taken to bear the same
proportion likewise to F, as E bears to D; then A shall bear
the same proportion to C, as D bears to G.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> secondary planets move round their respective
primary, much in the same manner as the primary do round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the sun. But the motions of these shall be more fully explained
hereafter<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. And there is, besides the planets, another
sort of bodies, which in all probability move round the sun;
I mean the comets. The farther description of which bodies
I also leave to the place, where they are to be particularly
treated on<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Far</span> without this system the fixed stars are placed.
These are all so remote from us, that we seem almost incapable
of contriving any means to estimate their distance. Their
number is exceeding great. Besides two or three thousand,
which we see with the naked eye, telescopes open to our view
vast numbers; and the farther improved these instruments
are, we still discover more and more. Without doubt these
are luminous globes, like our sun, and ranged through the
wide extent of space; each of which, it is to be supposed,
perform the same office, as our sun, affording light and heat
to certain planets moving about them. But these conjectures
are not to be pursued in this place.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> therefore now proceed to the particular design
of this chapter, and shew, that there is no sensible matter
lodged in the space where the planets move.</p>

<p><a name="c166" id="c166">11.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">That</span> they suffer no sensible resistance from any
such matter, is evident from the agreement between the observations
of astronomers in different ages, with regard to the
time, in which the planets have been found to perform their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
periods. But it was the opinion of <span class="smcap">Des&nbsp;Cartes</span><a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>, that the
planets might be kept in their courses by the means of a fluid
matter, which continually circulating round should carry
the planets along with it.  There is one appearance that
may seem to favour this opinion; which is, that the sun turns
round its own axis the same way, as the planets move.  The
earth also turns round its axis the same way, as the moon
moves round the earth. And the planet Jupiter turns upon
its axis the same way, as his satellites revolve round him. It
might therefore be supposed, that if the whole planetary region
were filled with a fluid matter, the sun, by turning round on
its own axis, might communicate motion first to that part of
the fluid, which was contiguous, and by degrees propagate
the like motion to the parts more remote. After the same
manner the earth might communicate motion to this fluid, to
a distance sufficient to carry round the moon, and Jupiter communicate
the like to the distance of its satellites.  Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac
Newton</em></span> has particularly examined what might be the result
of such a motion as this<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>; and he finds, that the velocities,
with which the parts of this fluid will move in different distances
from the center of the motion, will not agree with the
motion observed in different planets: for instance, that the
time of one intire circulation of the fluid, wherein Jupiter
should swim, would bear a greater proportion to the time of
one intire circulation of the fluid, where the earth is; than the
period of Jupiter bears to the period of the earth. But he
also proves<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>, that the planet cannot circulate in such a fluid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
so as to keep long in the same course, unless the planet and
the contiguous fluid are of the same density, and the planet
be carried along with the same degree of motion, as the fluid.
There is also another remark made upon this motion by our
author; which is, that some vivifying force will be continually
necessary at the center of the motion<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>. The sun in particular,
by communicating motion to the ambient fluid, will
lose from it self as much motion, as it imparts to the fluid;
unless some acting principle reside in the sun to renew its
motion continually. If the fluid be infinite, this gradual loss
of motion would continue till the whole should stop<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>; and
if the fluid were limited, this loss of motion would continue,
till there would remain no swifter a revolution in the sun,
than in the utmost part of the fluid; so that the whole
would turn together about the axis of the sun, like one solid
globe<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c168" id="c168">12.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is farther to be observed, that as the planets do not
move in perfect circles round the sun; there is a greater distance
between their orbits in some places, than in others. For
instance, the distance between the orbit of Mars and Venus is
near half as great again in one part of their orbits, as in the
opposite place. Now here the fluid, in which the earth
should swim, must move with a less rapid motion, where
there is this greater interval between the contiguous orbits; but
on the contrary, where the space is straitest, the earth moves
more slowly, than where it is widest<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Farther</span>, if this our globe of earth swam in a fluid
of equal density with the earth it self, that is, in a fluid more
dense than water; all bodies put in motion here upon the
earth’s surface must suffer a great resistance from it; where
as, by Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span>’s experiments mentioned in the
preceding chapter, bodies, that fell perpendicularly down
through the air, felt about 1/860 part only of the resistance,
which bodies suffered that fell in like manner through water.</p>

<p><a name="c169" id="c169">14.</a> Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> applies these experiments yet
farther, and examines by them the general question concerning
the absolute plenitude of space. According to the Aristotelians,
all space was full without any the least vacuities whatever.
<span class="smcap">DesCartes</span> embraced the same opinion, and therefore
supposed a subtile fluid matter, which should pervade all bodies,
and adequately fill up their pores. The Atomical philosophers,
who suppose all bodies both fluid and solid to be composed
of very minute but solid atoms, assert that no fluid, how
subtile soever the particles or atoms whereof it is composed
should be, can ever cause an absolute plenitude; because it
is impossible that any body can pass through the fluid without
putting the particles of it into such a motion, as to separate
them, at least in part, from one another, and so perpetually
to cause small vacuities; by which these Atomists endeavour
to prove, that a vacuum, or some space empty of all
matter, is absolutely necessary to be in nature. Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac
Newton</em></span> objects against the filling of space with such a subtile
fluid, that all bodies in motion must be unmeasurably resisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
by a fluid so dense, as absolutely to fill up all the space,
through which it is spread. And lest it should be thought,
that this objection might be evaded by ascribing to this fluid
such very minute and smooth parts, as might remove all adhesion
or friction between them, whereby all resistance
would be lost, which this fluid might otherwise give to bodies
moving in it; Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> proves, in the
manner above related, that fluids resist from the power of
inactivity of their particles; and that water and the air resist
almost entirely on this account: so that in this subtile
fluid, however minute and lubricated the particles, which
compose it, might be; yet if the whole fluid was as dense as
water, it would resist very near as much as water does; and
whereas such a fluid, whose parts are absolutely close together
without any intervening spaces, must be a great deal
more dense than water, it must resist more than water in
proportion to its greater density; unless we will suppose the
matter, of which this fluid is composed, not to be endued
with the same degree of inactivity as other matter. But if
you deprive any substance of the property so universally belonging
to all other matter, without impropriety of speech
it can scarce be called by this name.</p>

<p>15. Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> made also an experiment to try in
particular, whether the internal parts of bodies suffered any resistance.
And the result did indeed appear to favour some small
degree of resistance; but so very little, as to leave it doubtful,
whether the effect did not arise from some other latent cause<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>.</p>

Concerning the cause, which keeps in motion
the primary planets.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap08"><a name="c171b" id="c171b">SINCE</a> the planets move in a void space and are free
from resistance; they, like all other bodies, when
once in motion, would move on in a straight line without
end, if left to themselves. And it is now to be explained
what kind of action upon them carries them round the sun.
Here I shall treat of the primary planets only, and discourse
of the secondary apart in the next chapter. It has been
just now declared, that these primary planets move so about
the sun, that a line extended from the sun to the planet, will,
by accompanying the planet in its motion, pass over equal spaces
in equal portions of time<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. And this one property in the
motion of the planets proves, that they are continually acted
on by a power directed perpetually to the sun as a center. This
therefore is one property of the cause, which keeps the
planets in their courses, that it is a centripetal power, whose
center is the sun.</p>

<p><a name="c171c" id="c171c">2.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Again</span>, in the chapter upon centripetal forces<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> it
was observ’d, that if the strength of the centripetal power
was suitably accommodated every where to the motion of
any body round a center, the body might be carried in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
any bent line whatever, whose concavity should be every
where turned towards the center of the force. It was farther
remarked, that the strength of the centripetal force,
in each place, was to be collected from the nature of the
line, wherein the body moved<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. Now since each planet
moves in an ellipsis, and the sun is placed in one focus;
Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> deduces from hence, that the strength
of this power is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of the
distance from the sun. This is deduced from the properties,
which the geometers have discovered in the ellipsis. The process
of the reasoning is not proper to be enlarged upon here;
but I shall endeavour to explain what is meant by the reciprocal
duplicate proportion. Each of the terms reciprocal proportion,
and duplicate proportion, has been already defined<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.
Their sense when thus united is as follows. Suppose the planet
moved in the orbit A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C (in fig. 93.) about the sun in S.
Then, when it is said, that the centripetal power, which acts on
the planet in A, bears to the power acting on it in B a proportion,
which is the reciprocal of the duplicate proportion of the
distance S&nbsp;A to the distance S&nbsp;B; it is meant that the power
in A bears to the power in B the duplicate of the proportion
of the distance S&nbsp;B to the distance S&nbsp;A. The reciprocal duplicate
proportion may be explained also by numbers as follows.
Suppose several distances to bear to each other proportions
expressed by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; that is, let the
second distance be double the first, the third be three times,
the fourth four times, and the fifth five times as great as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
first. Multiply each of these numbers by it self, and 1 multiplied
by 1 produces still 1, 2 multiplied by 2 produces 4, 3
by 3 makes 9, 4 by 4 makes 16, and 5 by 5 gives 25. This
being done, the fractions ¼, 1/9, 1/16, 1/25, will respectively express
the proportion, which the centripetal power in each of the
following distances bears to the power at the first distance: for
in the second distance, which is double the first, the centripetal
power will be one fourth part only of the power at the
first distance; at the third distance the power will be one
ninth part only of the first power; at the fourth distance,
the power will be but one sixteenth part of the first; and at
the fifth distance, one twenty fifth part of the first power.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> is found the proportion, in which this centripetal
power decreases, as the distance from the sun increases, within
the compass of one planet’s motion. How it comes to pass,
that the planet can be carried about the sun by this centripetal
power in a continual round, sometimes rising from the sun,
then descending again as low, and from thence be carried
up again as far remote as before, alternately rising and falling
without end; appears from what has been written above concerning
centripetal forces: for the orbits of the planets resemble
in shape the curve line proposed in § 17 of the chapter
on these forces<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> farther, in order to know whether this centripetal
force extends in the same proportion throughout, and consequently
whether all the planets are influenced by the very same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
power, our author proceeds thus. He inquires what relation
there ought to be between the periods of the different planets,
provided they were acted upon by the same power decreasing
throughout in the forementioned proportion; and he finds,
that the period of each in this case would have that very relation
to the greater axis of its orbit, as I have declared above<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
to be found in the planets by the observations of astronomers.
And this puts it beyond question, that the different planets are
pressed towards the sun, in the same proportion to their distances,
as one planet is in its several distances. And thence
in the last place it is justly concluded, that there is such a
power acting towards the sun in the foresaid proportion at all
distances from it.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> power, when referred to the planets, our author
calls centripetal, when to the sun attractive; he gives it likewise
the name of gravity, because he finds it to be of the same
nature with that power of gravity, which is observed in our
earth, as will appear hereafter<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. By all these names he designs
only to signify a power endued with the properties before
mentioned; but by no means would he have it understood, as
if these names referred any way to the cause of it. In particular
in one place where he uses the name of attraction, he cautions
us expressly against implying any thing but a power directing
a body to a center without any reference to the cause
of it, whether residing in that center, or arising from any
external impulse<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="c175" id="c175">6.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> now, in these demonstrations some very minute inequalities
in the motion of the planets are neglected; which is
done with a great deal of judgment; for whatever be their
cause, the effects are very inconsiderable, they being so exceeding
small, that some astronomers have thought fit wholly to pass
them by<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>. However the excellency of this philosophy, when
in the hands of so great a geometer as our author, is such, that
it is able to trace the least variations of things up to their causes.
The only inequalities, which have been observed common to
all the planets, are the motion of the aphelion and the nodes.
The transverse axis of each orbit does not always remain fixed,
but moves about the sun with a very slow progressive
motion: nor do the planets keep constantly the same plane,
but change them, and the lines in which those planes intersect
each other by insensible degrees. The first of these
inequalities, which is the motion of the aphelion, may be accounted
for, by supposing the gravitation of the planets towards
the sun to differ a little from the forementioned reciprocal
duplicate proportion of the distances; but the second,
which is the motion of the nodes, cannot be accounted
for by any power directed towards the sun; for no such
can give the planet any lateral impulse to divert it from the
plane of its motion into any new plane, but of necessity must
be derived from some other center. Where that power is
lodged, remains to be discovered. Now it is proved, as
shall be explained in the following chapter, that the three
primary planets Saturn, Jupiter, and the earth, which have
satellites revolving about them, are endued with a power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
causing bodies, in particular those satellites, to gravitate towards
them with a force, which is reciprocally in the duplicate
proportion of their distances; and the planets are in all respects,
in which they come under our examination, so similar
and alike, that there is no reason to question, but they have
all the same property. Though it be sufficient for the present
purpose to have it proved of Jupiter and Saturn only; for
these planets contain much greater quantities of matter than
the rest, and proportionally exceed the others in power<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. But
the influence of these two planets being allowed, it is evident
how the planets come to shift continually their planes:
for each of the planets moving in a different plane, the
action of Jupiter and Saturn upon the rest will be oblique to
the planes of their motion; and therefore will gradually draw
them into new ones. The same action of these two planets upon
the rest will cause likewise a progressive motion of the
aphelion; so that there will be no necessity of having recourse
to the other cause for this motion, which was before hinted
at<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>; viz, the gravitation of the planets towards the sun differing
from the exact reciprocal duplicate proportion of the distances.
And in the last place, the action of Jupiter and Saturn
upon each other will produce in their motions the same inequalities,
as their joint action produces in the rest. All this
is effected in the same manner, as the sun produces the same
kind of inequalities and many others in the motion of the
moon and the other secondary planets; and therefore will be
best apprehended by what shall be said in the next chapter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Those other irregularities in the motion of the secondary
planets have place likewise here; but are too minute to be
observable: because they are produced and rectified alternately,
for the most part in the time of a single revolution;
whereas the motion of the aphelion and nodes, which continually
increase, become sensible in a long series of years. Yet
some of these other inequalities are discernible in Jupiter and
Saturn, in Saturn chiefly; for when Jupiter, who moves faster
than Saturn, approaches near to a conjunction with him, his
action upon Saturn will a little retard the motion of that planet,
and by the reciprocal action of Saturn he will himself be
accelerated. After conjunction, Jupiter will again accelerate
Saturn, and be likewise retarded in the same degree, as before
the first was retarded and the latter accelerated.  Whatever
inequalities besides are produced in the motion of Saturn by
the action of Jupiter upon that planet, will be sufficiently rectified,
by placing the focus of Saturn’s ellipsis, which should
otherwise be in the sun, in the common center of gravity of
the sun and Jupiter.  And all the inequalities in the motion
of Jupiter, caused by Saturn’s action upon him, are much
less considerable than the irregularities of Saturn’s motion<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> one principle therefore of the planets having a
power, as well as the sun, to cause bodies to gravitate towards
them, which is proved by the motion of the secondary planets
to obtain in fact, explains all the irregularities relating to
the planets ever observed by astronomers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="c178" id="c178">8.</a> Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> after this proceeds to make an
improvement in astronomy by applying this theory to the farther
correction of their motions. For as we have here observed
the planets to possess a principle of gravitation, as well as
the sun; so it will be explained at large hereafter, that the
third law of motion, which makes action and reaction equal,
is to be applied in this case<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>; and that the sun does not only
attract each planet, but is it self also attracted by them; the
force, wherewith the planet is acted on, bearing to the force,
wherewith the sun it self is acted on at the same time, the
proportion, which the quantity of matter in the sun bears to
the quantity of matter in the planet. From the action between
the sun and planet being thus mutual Sir <span class="smcap">Isaac
Newton</span> proves that the sun and planet will describe about
their common center of gravity similar ellipsis’s; and then that
the transverse axis of the ellipsis described thus about the moveable
sun, will bear to the transverse axis of the ellipsis, which
would be described about the sun at rest in the same time, the
same proportion as the quantity of solid matter in the sun and
planet together bears to the first of two mean proportionals between
this quantity and the quantity of matter in the sun only<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Above</span>, where I shewed how to find a cube, that
should bear any proportion to another cube<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>, the lines F&nbsp;T
and T&nbsp;S are two mean proportionals between E&nbsp;F and F&nbsp;G;
and counting from E&nbsp;F, F&nbsp;T is called the first, and F&nbsp;S the second
of those means. In numbers these mean proportionals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
are thus found.</p>

<p>Suppose A and B two numbers, and it be
required to find C the first, and D the second of
the two mean proportionals between them. First
multiply A by it self, and the product multiply
by B; then C will be the number which in arithmetic
is called the cubic root of this last product; that is,
the number C being multiplied by it self, and the product
again multiplied by the same number C, will produce the
product above mentioned. In like manner D is the cubic
root of the product of B multiplied by it self, and the produce
of that multiplication multiplied again by A.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> will be asked, perhaps, how this correction can be
admitted, when the cause of the motions of the planets was
before found by supposing the sun the center of the power,
which acted upon them: for according to the present correction
this power appears rather to be directed to their common
center of gravity. But whereas the sun was at first concluded
to be the center, to which the power acting on the planets
was directed, because the spaces described round the sun in
equal times were found to be equal; so Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span>
proves, that if the sun and planet move round their common
center of gravity, yet to an eye placed in the planet, the spaces,
which will appear to be described about the sun, will have
the same relation to the times of their description, as the real
spaces would have, if the sun were at rest<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>. I farther asserted,
that, supposing the planets to move round the sun at rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and to be attracted by a power, which every where should
act with degrees of strength reciprocally in the duplicate
proportion of the distances; then the periods of the planets
must observe the same relation to their distances, as astronomers
find them to do. But here it must not be supposed, that
the observations of astronomers absolutely agree without any
the least difference; and the present correction will not cause
a deviation from any one astronomer’s observations, so much
as they differ from one another. For in Jupiter, where this
correction is greatest, it hardly amounts to the 3000<sup>th</sup> part
of the whole axis.</p>

<p><a name="c180" id="c180">11.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Upon</span> this head I think it not improper to mention
a reflection made by our excellent author upon these small inequalities
in the planets motions; which contains under it a
very strong philosophical argument against the eternity of the
world. It is this, that these inequalities must continually increase
by slow degrees, till they render at length the present
frame of nature unfit for the purposes, it now serves<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>. And
a more convincing proof cannot be desired against the present
constitution’s having existed from eternity than this,
that a certain period of years will bring it to an end. I am
aware this thought of our author has been represented even
as impious, and as no less than casting a reflection upon
the wisdom of the author of nature, for framing a perishable
work. But I think so bold an assertion ought to have
been made with singular caution. For if this remark
upon the increasing irregularities of the heavenly motions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
be true in fact, as it really is, the imputation must return
upon the asserter, that this does detract from the divine
wisdom. Certainly we cannot pretend to know all the
omniscient Creator’s purposes in making this world, and
therefore cannot undertake to determine how long he designed
it should last. And it is sufficient, if it endure
the time intended by the author. The body of every animal
shews the unlimited wisdom of its author no less, nay
in many respects more, than the larger frame of nature;
and yet we see, they are all designed to last but a small
space of time.</p>

Of the motion of the MOON and the other
SECONDARY PLANETS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE excellency of this philosophy sufficiently appears
from its extending in the manner, which has been related,
to the minutest circumstances of the primary planets
motions; which nevertheless bears no proportion to the vast
success of it in the motions of the secondary; for it not only
accounts for all the irregularities, by which their motions were
known to be disturbed, but has discovered others so complicated,
that astronomers were never able to distinguish them, and
reduce them under proper heads; but these were only to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
found out from their causes, which this philosophy has brought
to light, and has shewn the dependence of these inequalities
upon such causes in so perfect a manner, that we not only learn
from thence in general, what those inequalities are, but are
able to compute the degree of them. Of this Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Is. Newton</em></span>
has given several specimens, and has moreover found means
to reduce the moon’s motion so completely to rule, that he
has framed a theory, from which the place of that planet
may at all times be computed, very nearly or altogether as exactly,
as the places of the primary planets themselves, which is
much beyond what the greatest astronomers could ever effect.</p>

<p><a name="c182" id="c182">2.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> first thing demonstrated of these secondary planets
is, that they are drawn towards their respective primary in the
same manner as the primary planets are attracted by the sun.
That each secondary planet is kept in its orbit by a power
pointed towards the center of the primary planet, about
which the secondary revolves; and that the power, by which
the secondaries of the same primary are influenced, bears the
same relation to the distance from the primary, as the power,
by which the primary planets are guided, does in regard to
the distance from the sun<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>. This is proved in the satellites of
Jupiter and Saturn, because they move in circles, as far as we
can observe, about their respective primary with an equable
course, the respective primary being the center of each orbit:
and by comparing the times, in which the different satellites
of the same primary perform their periods, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
found to observe the same relation to the distances from their
primary, as the primary planets observe in respect of their
mean distances from the sun<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.  Here these bodies moving in
circles with an equable motion, each satellite passes over equal
parts of its orbit in equal portions of time; consequently
the line drawn from the center of the orbit, that is, from
the primary planet, to the satellite, will pass over equal spaces
along with the satellite in equal portions of time; which
proves the power, by which each satellite is held in its orbit,
to be pointed towards the primary as a center<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. It is also manifest
that the centripetal power, which carries a body in a
circle concentrical with the power, acts upon the body at all
times with the same strength. But Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> demonstrates
that, when bodies are carried in different circles by
centripetal powers directed to the centers of those circles, then,
the degrees of strength of those powers are to be compared by
considering the relation between the times, in which the bodies
perform their periods through those circles<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>; and in particular
he shews, that if the periodical times bear that relation,
which I have just now asserted the satellites of the same primary
to observe; then the centripetal powers are reciprocally
in the duplicate proportion of the semidiameters of the circles,
or in that proportion to the distances of the bodies from the
centers<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>. Hence it follows that in the planets Jupiter and
Saturn, the centripetal power in each decreases with the increase
of distance, in the same proportion as the centripetal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
power appertaining to the sun decreases with the increase of
distance. I do not here mean that this proportion of the centripetal
powers holds between the power of Jupiter at any distance
compared with the power of Saturn at any other distance;
but only in the change of strength of the power belonging
to the same planet at different distances from him.
Moreover what is here discovered of the planets Jupiter and
Saturn by means of the different satellites, which revolve
round each of them, appears in the earth by the moon alone;
because she is found to move round the earth in an ellipsis after
the same manner as the primary planets do about the sun;
excepting only some small irregularities in her motion, the
cause of which will be particularly explained in what follows,
whereby it will appear, that they are no objection against
the earth’s acting on the moon in the same manner as the sun
acts on the primary planets; that is, as the other primary
planets Jupiter and Saturn act upon their satellites. Certainly
since these irregularities can be otherwise accounted for, we
ought not to depart from that rule of induction so necessary
in philosophy, that to like bodies like properties are to be attributed,
where no reason to the contrary appears. We cannot
therefore but ascribe to the earth the same kind of action
upon the moon, as the other primary planets Jupiter and Saturn
have upon their satellites; which is known to be very
exactly in the proportion assigned by the method of comparing
the periodical times and distances of all the satellites which
move about the same planet; this abundantly compensating
our not being near enough to observe the exact figure of
their orbits. For if the little deviation of the moon’s orbit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
orbit from a true permanent ellipsis arose from the action of the
earth upon the moon not being in the exact reciprocal duplicate
proportion of the distance, were another moon to revolve
about the earth, the proportion between the periodical times of
this new moon, and the present, would discover the deviation
from the mentioned proportion much more manifestly.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> the number of satellites, which move round Jupiter
and Saturn, the power of each of these planets is measured in
a great diversity of distance; for the distance of the outermost
satellite in each of these planets exceeds several times the distance
of the innermost. In Jupiter the astronomers have usually
placed the innermost satellite at a distance from the center of
that planet equal to about 5⅔ of the semidiameters of Jupiter’s
body, and this satellite performs its revolution in about 1 day
18½ hours. The next satellite, which revolves round Jupiter in
about 3 days 13⅕ hours, they place at the distance from Jupiter
of about 9 of that planet’s semidiameters. To the third satellite,
which performs its period nearly in 7 days 3¾ hours,
they assign the distance of about 14⅖ semidiameters. But
the outermost satellite they remove to 25⅓ semidiameters, and
this satellite makes its period in about 16 days 16½ hours<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>.
In Saturn there is still a greater diversity in the distance of the
several satellites. By the observations of the late <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Cassini</em></span>, a
celebrated astronomer in France, who first discovered all these
satellites, except one known before, the innermost is distant
about 4½ of Saturn’s semidiameters from his center, and revolves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
round in about 1 day 21⅓ hours. The next satellite
is distant about 5¾ semidiameters, and makes its period in about
2 days 17⅔ hours.  The third is removed to the distance
of about 8 semidiameters, and performs its revolution in
near 4 days 12½ hours. The fourth satellite discovered first
by the great <span class="smcap">Huygens</span>, is near 18⅔ semidiameters, and
moves round Saturn in about 15 days 22⅔ hours. The outermost
is distant 56 semidiameters, and makes its revolution
in about 79 days 7⅘ hours<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.  Besides these satellites, there
belongs to the planet Saturn another body of a very singular
kind. This is a shining, broad, and flat ring, which encompasses
the planet round. The diameter of the outermost
verge of this ring is more than double the diameter of Saturn.
<span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Huygens</em></span>, who first described this ring, makes the whole
diameter thereof to bear to the diameter of Saturn the proportion
of 9 to 4. The late reverend Mr. <span class="smcap">Pound</span> makes the
proportion something greater, viz. that of 7 to 3. The distances
of the satellites of this planet Saturn are compared by
<span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Cassini</em></span> to the diameter of the ring.  His numbers I have
reduced to those above, according to Mr. <span class="smcap">Pound</span>’s proportion
between the diameters of Saturn and of his ring. As
this ring appears to adhere no where to Saturn, so the distance
of Saturn from the inner edge of the ring seems rather
greater than the breadth of the ring. The distances, which
have here been given, of the several satellites, both for Jupiter
and Saturn, may be more depended on in relation to the
proportion, which those belonging to the same primary planet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
bear one to another, than in respect to the very numbers, that
have been here set down, by reason of the difficulty there is
in measuring to the greatest  exactness the diameters of the primary
planets; as will be explained hereafter, when we come
to treat of telescopes<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>. By the observations of the forementioned
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pound</span>, in Jupiter the distance of the innermost
satellite should rather be about 6 semidiameters, of the second
9-½, of the third 15, and of the outermost 26⅔<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>; and in Saturn
the distance of the innermost satellite 4 semidiameters,
of the next 6¼, of the third 8¾, of the fourth 20⅓, and of the
fifth 59<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>. However the proportion between the distances
of the satellites in the same primary is the only thing necessary
to the point we are here upon.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> moreover the force, wherewith the earth acts in
different distances, is confirmed from the following consideration,
yet more expresly than by the preceding analogical
reasoning. It will appear, that if the power of the earth, by
which it retains the moon in her orbit, be supposed to act at all
distances between the earth and moon, according to the forementioned
rule; this power will be sufficient to produce upon
bodies, near the surface of the earth, all the effects ascribed
to the principle of gravity. This is discovered by the following
method. Let A (in fig. 94.) represent the earth,
B the moon, B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D the moon’s orbit, which differs little from
a circle, of which A is the center. If the moon in B were
left to it self to move with the velocity, it has in the point B, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
would leave the orbit, and proceed right forward in the line
B&nbsp;E, which touches the orbit in B. Suppose the moon would
upon this condition move from B to E in the space of one minute
of time. By the action of the earth upon the moon, whereby
it is retained in its orbit, the moon will really be found at the
end of this minute in the point F, from whence a straight line
drawn to A shall make the space B&nbsp;F&nbsp;A in the circle equal to the
triangular space B&nbsp;E&nbsp;A; so that the moon in the time wherein
it would have moved from B to E, if left to it self, has been
impelled towards the earth from E to F. And when the time
of the moon’s passing from B to F is small, as here it is only
one minute, the distance between E and F scarce differs from
the space, through which the moon would descend in the
same time, if it were to fall directly down from B toward A
without any other motion. A&nbsp;B the distance of the earth and
moon is about 60 of the earth’s semidiameters, and the moon
completes her revolution round the earth in about 27 days
7 hours and 43 minutes: therefore the space E&nbsp;F will here be
found by computation to be about 16⅛ feet. Consequently,
if the power, by which the moon is retained in its orbit, be
near the surface of the earth greater, than at the distance of
the moon in the duplicate proportion of that distance; the
number of feet, a body would descend near the surface of the
earth by the action of this power upon it in one minute of
time, would be equal to 16⅛ multiplied twice into the number
60, that is, equal to 58050. But how fast bodies fall near
the surface of the earth may be known by the pendulum<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
by the exactest experiments they are found to descend the space
of 16⅛ feet in a second of time; and the spaces described by
falling bodies being in the duplicate proportion of the times
of their fall<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>, the number of feet, a body would describe in its
fall near the surface of the earth in one minute of time, will
be equal to 16⅛ twice multiplied by 60, the same as would
be caused by the power which acts upon the moon.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> this computation the earth is supposed to be at
rest, whereas it would have been more exact to have supposed
it to move, as well as the moon, about their common
center of gravity; as will easily be understood, by what
has been said in the preceding chapter, where it was shewn,
that the sun is subjected to the like motion about the common
center of gravity of it self and the planets. The action
of the sun upon the moon, which is to be explain’d
in what follows, is likewise here neglected: and Sir <span class="smcap">Isaac
Newton</span> shews, if you take in both these considerations,
the present computation will best agree to a somewhat greater
distance of the moon and earth, viz. to 60½ semidiameters
of the earth, which distance is more conformable to
astronomical observations.</p>

<p><a name="c189" id="c189">6.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> computations afford an additional proof, that
the action of the earth observes the same proportion to the
distance, which is here contended for. Before I said, it
was reasonable to conclude so by induction from the planets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Jupiter and Saturn; because they act in that manner.
But now the same thing will be evident by drawing no other
consequence from what is seen in those planets, than that the
power, by which the primary planets act on their secondary,
is extended from the primary through the whole interval between,
so that it would act in every part of the intermediate
space. In Jupiter and Saturn this power is so far from being
confined to a small extent of distance, that it not only reaches
to several satellites at very different distances, but also from
one planet to the other, nay even through the whole planetary
system<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>. Consequently there is no appearance of reason,
why this power should not act at all distances, even at the
very surfaces of these planets as well as farther off. But from
hence it follows, that the power, which retains the moon
in her orbit, is the same, as causes bodies near the surface of
the earth to gravitate. For since the power, by which the
earth acts on the moon, will cause bodies near the surface
of the earth to descend with all the velocity they are found
to do, it is certain no other power can act upon them
besides; because if it did, they must of necessity descend
swifter. Now from all this it is at length very evident,
that the power in the earth, which we call gravity, extends
up to the moon, and decreases in the duplicate proportion
of the increase of the distance from the earth.</p>

<p><a name="c190" id="c190">7.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> finishes the discoveries made in the action of
the primary planets upon their secondary. The next thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to be shewn is, that the sun acts upon them likewise: for
this purpose it is to be observed, that if to the motion of the
satellite, whereby it would be carried round its primary at
rest, be superadded the same motion both in regard to
velocity and direction, as the primary it self has, it will
describe about the primary the same orbit, with as great
regularity, as if the primary was indeed at rest. The
cause of this is that law of motion, which makes a
body near the surface of the earth, when let fall, to
descend perpendicularly, though the earth be in so swift
a motion, that if the falling body did not partake of it,
its descent would be remarkably oblique; and that a body
projected describes in the most regular manner the same
parabola, whether projected in the direction, in which the
earth moves, or in the opposite direction, if the projecting
force be the same<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>. From this we learn, that
if the satellite moved about its primary with perfect regularity,
besides its motion about the primary, it would
participate of all the motion of its primary; have the
same progressive velocity, with which the primary is carried
about the sun; and be impelled with the same velocity
as the primary towards the sun, in a direction parallel
to that impulse of its primary. And on the contrary, the
want of either of these, in particular of the impulse towards
the sun, will occasion great inequalities in the motion
of the secondary planet. The inequalities, which would
arise from the absence of this impulse towards the sun are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
so great, that by the regularity, which appears in the motion
of the secondary planets, it is proved, that the sun communicates,
the same velocity to them by its action, as it gives
to their primary at the same distance. For Sir <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span>
informs us, that upon examination he found, that if
any of the satellites of Jupiter were attracted by the sun
more or less, than Jupiter himself at the same distance, the
orbit of that satellite, instead of being concentrical to Jupiter,
must have its center at a greater or less distance, than
the center of Jupiter from the sun, nearly in the subduplicate
proportion of the difference between the sun’s action upon
the satellite, and upon Jupiter; and therefore if any satellite
were attracted by the sun but 1/1000 part more or less,
than Jupiter is at the same distance, the center of the
orbit of that satellite would be distant from the center of
Jupiter no less than a fifth part of the distance of the outermost
satellite from Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>; which is almost the whole
distance of the innermost satellite. By the like argument
the satellites of Saturn gravitate towards the sun, as much
as Saturn it self at the same distance; and the moon as
much as the earth.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> is proved, that the sun acts upon the secondary
planets, as much as upon the primary at the same
distance: but it was found in the last chapter, that the
action of the sun upon bodies is reciprocally in the duplicate
proportion of the distance; therefore the secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
planets being sometimes nearer to the sun than the primary,
and sometimes more remote, they are not alway
acted upon in the same degree with their primary, but
when nearer to the sun, are attracted more, and when farther
distant, are attracted less. Hence arise various inequalities
in the motion of the secondary planets<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c193" id="c193">9.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Some</span> of these inequalities would take place, though
the moon, if undisturbed by the sun, would have moved in
a circle concentrical to the earth, and in the plane of the earth’s
motion; others depend on the elliptical figure, and the oblique
situation of the moon’s orbit. One of the first kind is,
that the moon is caused so to move, as not to describe equal
spaces in equal times, but is continually accelerated, as she
passes from the quarter to the new or full, and is retarded
again by the like degrees in returning from the new and full
to the next quarter. Here we consider not so much the absolute,
as the apparent motion of the moon in respect to us.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> principles of astronomy teach how to distinguish
these two motions. Let S (in fig. 95.) represent the
sun, A the earth moving in its orbit B&nbsp;C, D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F&nbsp;G the moon’s
orbit, the place of the moon H. Suppose the earth to have
moved from A to I. Because it has been shewn, that the
moon partakes of all the progressive motion of the earth; and
likewise that the sun attracts both the earth and moon equally,
when they are at the same distance from it, or that the
mean action of the sun upon the moon is equal to its action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
upon the earth: we must therefore consider the earth as carrying
about with it the moon’s orbit; so that when the
earth is removed from A to I, the moon’s orbit shall likewise
be removed from its former situation into that denoted
by K&nbsp;L&nbsp;M&nbsp;N. But now the earth being in I, if the moon
were found in O, so that O&nbsp;I should be parallel to H&nbsp;A,
though the moon would really have moved from H to O, yet
it would not have appeared to a spectator upon the earth to
have moved at all, because the earth has moved as much it
self; so that the moon would still appear in the same place
with respect to the fixed stars. But if the moon be observed
in P, it will then appear to have moved, its apparent motion
being measured by the angle under O&nbsp;I&nbsp;P. And if the angle
under P&nbsp;I&nbsp;S be less than the angle under H&nbsp;A&nbsp;S, the moon
will have approached nearer to its conjunction with the sun.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap gesperrt">To</span> come now to the explication of the mentioned
inequality in the moon’s motion: let S (in fig. 96.) represent
the sun, A the earth, B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E the moon’s orbit, C the place of the
moon, when in the latter quarter. Here it will be nearly at the
same distance from the sun, as the earth is. In this case therefore
they will both be equally attracted, the earth in the direction
A&nbsp;S, and the moon in the direction C&nbsp;S. Whence as the
earth in moving round the sun is continually descending toward
it, so the moon in this situation must in any equal portion
of time descend as much; and therefore the position of
the line A&nbsp;C in respect of A&nbsp;S, and the change, which the
moon’s motion produces in the angle under C&nbsp;A&nbsp;S, will not be
altered by the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> now as soon as ever the moon is advanced from
the quarter toward the new or conjunction, suppose to G,
the action of the sun upon it will have a different effect. Here,
were the sun’s action upon the moon to be applied in the direction
G&nbsp;H parallel to A&nbsp;S, if its action on the moon were
equal to its action on the earth, no change would be wrought
by the sun on the apparent motion of the moon round the
earth. But the moon receiving a greater impulse in G than
the earth receives in A, were the sun to act in the direction
G&nbsp;H, yet it would accelerate the description of the space
D&nbsp;A&nbsp;G, and cause the angle under G&nbsp;A&nbsp;D to decrease faster,
than otherwise it would. The sun’s action will have this effect
upon account of the obliquity of its direction to that, in
which the earth attracts the moon. For the moon by this
means is drawn by two forces oblique to each other, one
drawing from G toward A, the other from G toward H,
therefore the moon must necessarily be impelled toward D.
Again, because the sun does not act in the direction G&nbsp;H parallel
to S&nbsp;A, but in the direction G&nbsp;S oblique to it, the sun’s
action on the moon will by reason of this obliquity farther contribute
to the moon’s acceleration. Suppose the earth in any
short space of time would have moved from A to I, if not
attracted by the sun; the point I being in the straight line C&nbsp;E,
which touches the earth’s orbit in A. Suppose the moon in
the same time would have moved in her orbit from G to K,
and besides have partook of all the progressive motion of the
earth. Then if K&nbsp;L be drawn parallel to A&nbsp;I, and taken equal
to it, the moon, if not attracted by the sun, would be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in L. But the earth by the sun’s action is removed from I. Suppose
it were moved down to M in the line I&nbsp;M&nbsp;N parallel
to S&nbsp;A, and if the moon were attracted but as much, and in
the same direction, as the earth is here supposed to be attracted,
so as to have descended during the same time in the line L&nbsp;O,
parallel also to A&nbsp;S, down as far as P, till L&nbsp;P were equal
to I&nbsp;M; the angle under P&nbsp;M&nbsp;N would be equal to that
under L&nbsp;I&nbsp;N, that is, the moon will appear advanced no farther
forward, than if neither it nor the earth had been subject
to the sun’s action. But this is upon the supposition, that the
action of the sun upon the moon and earth were equal;
whereas the moon being acted upon more than the earth, did
the sun’s action draw the moon in the line L&nbsp;O parallel to A&nbsp;S,
it would draw it down so far as to make L&nbsp;P greater than
I&nbsp;M; whereby the angle under P&nbsp;M&nbsp;N will be rendred less,
than that under L&nbsp;I&nbsp;N. But moreover, as the sun draws the
earth in a direction oblique to I&nbsp;N, the earth will be found
in its orbit somewhat short of the point M; however the
moon is attracted by the sun still more out of the line L&nbsp;O,
than the earth is out of the line I&nbsp;N; therefore this obliquity
of the sun’s action will yet farther diminish the angle
under P&nbsp;M&nbsp;N.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> the moon at the point G receives an impulse
from the sun, whereby her motion is accelerated. And the
sun producing this effect in every place between the quarter
and the conjunction, the moon will move from the quarter
with a motion continually more and more accelerated; and
therefore by acquiring from time to time additional degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of velocity in its orbit, the spaces, which are described in
equal times by the line drawn from the earth to the moon, will
not be every where equal, but those toward the conjunction
will be greater, than those toward the quarter. But now in
the moon’s passage from the conjunction D to the next quarter
the sun’s action will again retard the moon, till at the next
quarter in E it be restored to the first velocity, which it had
in C.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Again</span> as the moon moves from E to the full or opposition
to the sun in B, it is again accelerated, the deficiency
of the sun’s action upon the moon, from what it has upon the
earth, producing here the same effect as before the excess of its
action. Consider the moon in Q, moving from E towards B.
Here if the moon were attracted by the sun in a direction
parallel to A&nbsp;S, yet being acted on less than the earth, as
the earth descends toward the sun, the moon will in some
measure be left behind. Therefore Q&nbsp;F being drawn parallel
to S&nbsp;B, a spectator on the earth would see the moon
move, as if attracted from the point Q in the direction
Q&nbsp;F with a degree of force equal to that, whereby the sun’s
action on the moon falls short of its action on the earth. But
the obliquity of the sun’s action has also here an effect. In
the time the earth would have moved from A to I without the
influence of the sun, let the moon have moved in its orbit from
Q to R. Drawing therefore R&nbsp;T parallel to A&nbsp;I, and equal to the
same, for the like reason as before, the moon by the motion of
its orbit, if not at all attracted by the sun, must be found in T;
and therefore, if attracted in a direction parallel to S&nbsp;A, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
be in the line T&nbsp;V parallel to A&nbsp;S; suppose in W. But the
moon in Q being farther off the sun than the earth, it will be
less attracted, that is, T&nbsp;W will be less than I&nbsp;M, and if the
line S&nbsp;M be prolonged toward X, the angle under X&nbsp;M&nbsp;W
will be less than that under X&nbsp;I&nbsp;T. Thus by the sun’s action
the moon’s passage from the quarter to the full would be accelerated,
if the sun were to act on the earth and moon in a
direction parallel to A&nbsp;S: and the obliquity of the sun’s action
will still more increase this acceleration. For the action
of the sun on the moon is oblique to the line S&nbsp;A the whole
time of the moon’s passage from Q to T, and will carry
the moon out of the line T&nbsp;V toward the earth. Here I suppose
the time of the moon’s passage from Q to T so short, that
it shall not pass beyond the line S&nbsp;A. The earth also will come
a little short of the line I&nbsp;N, as was said before. From these
causes the angle under X&nbsp;M&nbsp;W will be still farther lessened.</p>

<p><a name="c198" id="c198">15.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> moon in passing from the opposition B to the
next quarter will be retarded again by the same degrees, as
it is accelerated before its appulse to the opposition. Because
this action of the sun, which in the moon’s passage from the
quarter to the opposition causes it to be extraordinarily accelerated,
and diminishes the angle, which measures its distance
from the opposition; will make the moon slacken its pace afterwards,
and retard the augmentation of the same angle in
its passage from the opposition to the following quarter; that
is, will prevent that angle from increasing so fast, as otherwise
it would. And thus the moon, by the sun’s action upon it, is
twice accelerated and twice restored to its first velocity, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
circuit it makes round the earth. This inequality of the moon’s
motion about the earth is called by astronomers its variation.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> next effect of the sun upon the moon is, that it
gives the orbit of the moon in the quarters a greater degree
of curvature, than it would receive from the action of
the earth alone; and on the contrary in the conjunction and
opposition the orbit is less inflected.</p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap gesperrt">When</span> the moon is in conjunction with the sun in
the point D, the sun attracting the moon more forcibly than
it does the earth, the moon by that means is impelled less toward
the earth, than otherwise it would be, and so the orbit
is less incurvated; for the power, by which the moon is impelled
toward the earth, being that, by which it is inflected
from a rectilinear course, the less that power is, the less it
will be inflected. Again, when the moon is in the opposition
in B, farther removed from the sun than the earth is;
it follows then, though the earth and moon are both continually
descending to the sun, that is, are drawn by the sun
toward it self out of the place they would otherwise move
into, yet the moon descends with less velocity than the
earth; insomuch that the moon in any given space of
time from its passing the point of opposition will have
less approached the earth, than otherwise it would have
done, that is, its orbit in respect of the earth will approach
nearer to a straight line. In the last place, when
the moon is in the quarter in F, and equally distant
from the sun as the earth, we observed before, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the earth and moon would descend with equal pace toward
the sun, so as to make no change by that descent
in the angle under F&nbsp;A&nbsp;S; but the length of the line F&nbsp;A must
of necessity be shortned. Therefore the moon in moving from
F toward the conjunction with the sun will be impelled more
toward the earth by the sun’s action, than it would have been
by the earth alone, if neither the earth nor moon had been
acted on by the sun; so that by this additional impulse the
orbit is rendred more curve, than it would otherwise be.
The same effect will also be produced in the other quarter.</p>

<p><a name="c200" id="c200">18.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Another</span> effect of the sun’s action, consequent upon
this we have now explained, is, that though the moon undisturbed
by the sun might move in a circle having the earth
for its center; by the sun’s action, if the earth were to be
in the very middle or center of the moon’s orbit, yet the
moon would be nearer the earth at the new and full, than
in the quarters. In this probably will at first appear some
difficulty, that the moon should come nearest to the earth,
where it is least attracted to it, and be farthest off when most
attracted. Which yet will appear evidently to follow from
that very cause, by considering what was last shewn, that the
orbit of the moon in the conjunction and opposition is rendred
less curve; for the less curve the orbit of the moon is,
the less will the moon have descended from the place
it would move into, without the action of the earth. Now
if the moon were to move from any place without farther
disturbance from that action, since it would proceed in
the line, which would touch its orbit in that place, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
recede continually from the earth; and therefore if the power
of the earth upon the moon, be sufficient to retain it at
the same distance, this diminution of that power will cause
the distance to increase, though in a less degree. But on the
other hand in the quarters, the moon, being pressed more towards
the earth than by the earth’s single action, will be
made to approach it; so that in passing from the conjunction
or opposition to the quarters the moon ascends from the
earth, and in passing from the quarters to the conjunction
and opposition it descends again, becoming nearer in these
last mentioned places than in the other.</p>

<p><a name="c201a" id="c201a">19.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">All</span> these forementioned inequalities are of different
degrees, according as the sun is more or less distant from the
earth; greater when the earth is nearest the sun, and less
when it is farthest off. For in the quarters, the nearer the
moon is to the sun, the greater is the addition to the earth’s
action upon it by the power of the sun; and in the conjunction
and opposition, the difference between the sun’s action
upon the earth and upon the moon is likewise so much the
greater.</p>

<p><a name="c201b" id="c201b">20.</a> This difference in the distance between the earth
and the sun produces a farther effect upon the moon’s motion;
causing the orbit to dilate when less remote from the
sun, and become greater, than when at a farther distance.
For it is proved by Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em>, that the action of
the sun, by which it diminishes the earth’s power over the
moon, in the conjunction or opposition, is about twice as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
great, as the addition to the earth’s action by the sun in the
quarters<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>; so that upon the whole, the power of the earth
upon the moon is diminished by the sun, and therefore is
most diminished, when the action of the sun is strongest: but
as the earth by its approach to the sun has its influence lessened,
the moon being less attracted will gradually recede from
the earth; and as the earth in its recess from the sun recovers
by degrees its former power, the orbit of the moon must again
contract. Two consequences follow from hence: the
moon will be most remote from the earth, when the earth is
nearest the sun; and also will take up a longer time in performing
its revolution through the dilated orbit, than through
the more contracted.</p>

<p><a name="c202" id="c202">21.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> irregularities the sun would produce in the
moon, if the moon, without being acted on unequally by the
sun, would describe a perfect circle about the earth, and in
the plane of the earth’s motion; but though neither of these
suppositions obtain in the motion of the moon, yet the forementioned
inequalities will take place, only with some difference
in respect to the degree of them; but the moon by not
moving in this manner is subject to some other inequalities also.
For as the moon describes, instead of a circle concentrical
to the earth, an ellipsis, with the earth in one focus, that
ellipsis will be subjected to various changes. It can neither
preserve constantly the same position, nor yet the same figure;
and because the plane of this ellipsis is not the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with that of the earth’s orbit, the situation of the plane, wherein
the moon moves, will continually change; neither the line
in which it intersects the plane of the earth’s orbit, nor the
inclination of the planes to each other, will remain for any
time the same. All these alterations offer themselves now to
be explained.</p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> first consider the changes which are made
in the plane of the moon’s orbit. The moon not moving
in the same plane with the earth, the sun is seldom in the
plane of the moon’s orbit, viz. only when the line made by
the common intersection of the two planes, if produced,
will pass through the sun, as is represented in fig. 97. where
S denotes the sun; T the earth; A&nbsp;T&nbsp;B the earth’s orbit described
upon the plane of this scheme; C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F the moon’s
orbit, the part C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E being raised above, and the part C&nbsp;F&nbsp;E
depressed under the plane of this scheme. Here the line C&nbsp;E,
in which the plane of this scheme, that is, the plane of the
earth’s orbit and the plane of the moon’s orbit intersect each
other, being continued passes through the sun in S. When
this happens, the action of the sun is directed in the plane
of the moon’s orbit, and cannot draw the moon out of this
plane, as will evidently appear to any one that shall consider
the present scheme: for suppose the moon in G, and let a
straight line be drawn from G to S, the sun draws the moon
in the direction of this line from G toward S: but this line lies
in the plane of the orbit; and if it be prolonged from S beyond
G, the continuation of it will lie on the plane C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E; for the
plane itself, if sufficiently extended, will pass through the sun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
But in other cases the obliquity of the sun’s action to the plane
of the orbit will cause this plane continually to change.</p>

<p>23. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Suppose</span> in the first place, the line, in which the two
planes intersect each other, to be perpendicular to the line
which joins the earth and sun. Let T (in fig. 98, 99, 100, 101.)
represent the earth; S the sun; the plane of this scheme the
plane of the earth’s motion, in which both the sun and earth
are placed. Let A&nbsp;C be perpendicular to S&nbsp;T, which joins the
earth and sun; and let the line A&nbsp;C be that, in which the plane
of the moon’s orbit intersects the plane of the earth’s motion.
To the center T describe in the plane of the earth’s motion
the circle A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D. And in the plane of the moon’s orbit
describe the circle A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C&nbsp;F, one half of which A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C will
be elevated above the plane of this scheme, the other half
A&nbsp;F&nbsp;C as much depressed below it.</p>

<p>24. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> suppose the moon to set forth from the point A
(in fig. 98.) in the direction of the plane A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C. Here she
will be continually drawn out of this plane by the action of
the sun: for this plane A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C, if extended, will not pass through
the sun, but above it; so that the sun, by drawing the moon
directly toward it self, will force it continually more and more
from that plane towards the plane of the earth’s motion, in
which it self is; causing it to describe the line A&nbsp;K&nbsp;G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I, which
will be convex to the plane A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C, and concave to the plane
of the earth’s motion. But here this power of the sun, which
is said to draw the moon toward the plane of the earth’s
motion, must be understood principally of so much only of
the sun’s action upon the moon, as it exceeds the action of the
same upon the earth. For suppose the preceding figure to be
viewed by the eye, placed in the plane of that scheme, and in
the line C&nbsp;T&nbsp;A on the side of A, the plane A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D will appear as
the straight line D&nbsp;T&nbsp;B, (in fig. 102.) and the plane A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C&nbsp;F as another
straight line F&nbsp;E; and the curve line A&nbsp;K&nbsp;G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I under the
form of the line T&nbsp;K&nbsp;G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>Now it is plain, that the earth and
moon being both attracted by the sun, if the sun’s action upon
both was equally strong, the earth T, and with it the plane
A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C&nbsp;F or line F&nbsp;T&nbsp;E in this scheme, would be carried toward
the sun with as great a pace as the moon, and therefore the
moon not drawn out of it by the sun’s action, excepting
only from the small obliquity of the direction of this action
upon the moon to that of the sun’s action upon the earth,
which arises from the moon’s being out of the plane of the
earth’s motion, and is not very considerable; but the action
of the sun upon the moon being greater than upon the earth,
all the time the moon is nearer to the sun than the earth is,
it will be drawn from the plane A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C or the line T&nbsp;E by
that excess, and made to describe the curve line A&nbsp;G&nbsp;I or
T&nbsp;G&nbsp;I. But it is the custom of astronomers, instead of considering
the moon as moving in such a curve line, to refer
its motion continually to the plane, which touches the true
line wherein it moves, at the point where at any time the
moon is. Thus when the moon is in the point A, its motion
is considered as being in the plane A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C, in whose direction it
then essaies to move; and when in the point K (in fig. 99.)
its motion is referred to the plane, which passes through the
earth, and touches the line A&nbsp;K&nbsp;G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I in the point K. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the moon in passing from A to I will continually change the
plane of her motion. In what manner this change proceeds,
I shall now particularly explain.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Let</span> the plane, which touches the line A&nbsp;K&nbsp;I in the point
K (in fig. 99.) intersect the plane of the earth’s orbit in the line
L&nbsp;T&nbsp;M. Then, because the line A&nbsp;K&nbsp;I is concave to the plane
A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C, it falls wholly between that plane, and the plane which
touches it in K; so that the plane M&nbsp;K&nbsp;L will cut the plane A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C,
before it meets with the plane of the earth’s motion; suppose
in the line Y&nbsp;T, and the point A will fall between K and L.
With a semidiameter equal to T&nbsp;Y or T&nbsp;L describe the semicircle
L&nbsp;Y&nbsp;M. Now to a spectator on the earth the moon, when
in A, will appear to move in the circle A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C&nbsp;F, and, when in
K, will appear to be moving in the semicircle L&nbsp;Y&nbsp;M. The
earth’s motion is performed in the plane of this scheme, and
to a spectator on the earth the sun will appear always moving
in that plane. We may therefore refer the apparent motion
of the sun to the circle A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D, described in this plane about
the earth. But the points where this circle, in which the
sun seems to move, intersects the circle in which the moon
is seen at any time to move, are called the nodes of the moon’s
orbit at that time. When the moon is seen moving in the circle
A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C&nbsp;D, the points A and C are the nodes of the orbit;
when she appears in the semicircle L&nbsp;Y&nbsp;M, then L and M are
the nodes. Now here it appears, from what has been said,
that while the moon has moved from A to K, one of the
nodes has been carried from A to L, and the other as much
from C to M. But the motion from A to L, and from C to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
M, is backward in regard to the motion of the moon, which
is the other way from A to K, and from thence toward C.</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Farther</span> the angle, which the plane, wherein the
moon at any time appears, makes with the plane of the earth’s
motion, is called the inclination of the moon’s orbit at that
time. And I shall now proceed to shew, that this inclination
of the orbit, when the moon is in K, is less than when
she was in A; or, that the plane L&nbsp;Y&nbsp;M, which touches the
line of the moon’s motion in K, makes a less angle with the
plane of the earth’s motion or with the circle A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D, than
the plane A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C makes with the same. The semicircle L&nbsp;Y&nbsp;M
intersects the semicircle A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C in Y; and the arch A&nbsp;Y is less
than L&nbsp;Y, and both together less than half a circle. But it is demonstrated
by the writers on that part of astronomy, which is
called the doctrine of the sphere, that when a triangle is made,
as here, by three arches of circles A&nbsp;L, A&nbsp;Y, and Y&nbsp;L, the angle
under Y&nbsp;A&nbsp;B without the triangle is greater than the angle under
Y&nbsp;L&nbsp;A within, if the two arches A&nbsp;Y, Y&nbsp;L taken together do
not amount to a semicircle; if the two arches make a complete
semicircle, the two angles will be equal; but if the two
arches taken together exceed a semicircle, the inner angle under
Y&nbsp;L&nbsp;A is greater than the other<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>. Here therefore the two
arches A&nbsp;Y and L&nbsp;Y together being less than a semicircle, the
angle under A&nbsp;L&nbsp;Y is less, than the angle under B&nbsp;A&nbsp;E. But
from the doctrine of the sphere it is also evident, that the angle
under A&nbsp;L&nbsp;Y is equal to that, in which the plane of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
circle L&nbsp;Y&nbsp;K&nbsp;M, that is, the plane which touches the line A&nbsp;K&nbsp;G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I
in K, is inclined to the plane of the earth’s motion A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C;
and the angle under B&nbsp;A&nbsp;E is equal to that, in which the plane
A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C is inclined to the same plane. Therefore the inclination
of the former plane is less than the inclination of the latter.</p>

<p>27. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Suppose</span> now the moon to be advanced to the point
G (in fig. 100.) and in this point to be distant from its node
a quarter part of the whole circle; or in other words, to be
in the midway between its two nodes. And in this case the
nodes will have receded yet more, and the inclination of the
orbit be still more diminished: for suppose the line A&nbsp;K&nbsp;G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I
to be touched in the point G by a plane passing through the
earth T: let the intersection of this plane with the plane of
the earth’s motion be the line W&nbsp;T&nbsp;O, and the line T&nbsp;P its intersection
with the plane L&nbsp;K&nbsp;M. In this plane let the circle
N&nbsp;G&nbsp;O be described with the semidiameter T&nbsp;P or N&nbsp;T cutting
the other circle L&nbsp;K&nbsp;M in P. Now the line A&nbsp;K&nbsp;G&nbsp;I is convex
to the plane L&nbsp;K&nbsp;M, which touches it in K; and therefore the
plane N&nbsp;G&nbsp;O, which touches it in G, will intersect the other
touching plane between G and K; that is, the point P will fall
between those two points, and the plane continued to the
plane of the earth’s motion will pass beyond L; so that the
points N and O, or the places of the nodes, when the moon
is in G, will be farther from A and C than L and M, that is,
will have moved farther backward. Besides, the inclination
of the plane N&nbsp;G&nbsp;O to the plane of the earth’s motion A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C
is less, than the inclination of the plane L&nbsp;K&nbsp;M to the same; for
here also the two arches L&nbsp;P and N&nbsp;P taken together are less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
than a semicircle, each of these arches being less than a quarter
of a circle; as appears, because G&nbsp;N, the distance of the
moon in G from its node N, is here supposed to be a quarter
part of a circle.</p>

<p>28. <span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> the moon is passed beyond G, the case is altered;
for then these arches will be greater than quarters of the circle,
by which means the inclination will be again increased, tho’
the nodes still go on to move the same way. Suppose the
moon in H, (in fig. 101.) and that the plane, which touches
the line A&nbsp;K&nbsp;G&nbsp;I in H, intersects the plane of the earth’s motion
in the line Q&nbsp;T&nbsp;R, and the plane N&nbsp;G&nbsp;O in the line T&nbsp;V,
and besides that the circle Q&nbsp;H&nbsp;R be described in that plane;
then, for the same reason as before, the point V will fall between
H and G, and the plane R&nbsp;V&nbsp;Q will pass beyond the
last plane O&nbsp;V&nbsp;N, causing the points Q and R to fall farther
from A and C than N and O. But the arches N&nbsp;V, V&nbsp;Q are
each greater than a quarter of a circle, N&nbsp;V the least of them
being greater than G&nbsp;N, which is a quarter of a circle; and
therefore the two arches N&nbsp;V and V&nbsp;Q together exceed a semicircle;
consequently the angle under B&nbsp;Q&nbsp;V will be greater,
than that under B&nbsp;N&nbsp;V.</p>

<p>29. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the last place, when the moon is by this attraction
of the sun, drawn at length into the plane of the earth’s
motion, the node will have receded yet more, and the inclination
be so much increased, as to become somewhat more
than at first: for the line A&nbsp;K&nbsp;G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I being convex to all the
planes, which touch it, the part H&nbsp;I will wholly fall between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the plane Q&nbsp;V&nbsp;R and the plane A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C; so that the point I will fall
between B and R; and drawing I&nbsp;T&nbsp;W, the point W will be farther
remov’d from A than Q. But it is evident, that the plane,
which passes through the earth T, and touches the line A&nbsp;G&nbsp;I
in the point I, will cut the plane of the earth’s motion A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D
in the line I&nbsp;T&nbsp;W, and be inclined to the same in the angle under
H&nbsp;I&nbsp;B; so that the node, which was first in A, after having
passed into L, N and Q, comes at last into the point W; as the
node which was at first in C has passed successively from thence
through the points M, O and R to I: but the angle under H&nbsp;I&nbsp;B,
which is now the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the
ecliptic, is manifestly not less than the angle under E&nbsp;C&nbsp;B or
E&nbsp;A&nbsp;B, but rather something greater.</p>

<p>30. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> the moon in the case before us, while it passes
from the plane of the earth’s motion in the quarter, till it
comes again into the same plane, has the nodes of its orbit
continually moved backward, and the inclination of its orbit
is at first diminished, viz. till it comes to G in fig. 100, which is
near to its conjunction with the sun, but afterwards is increased
again almost by the same degrees, till upon the moon’s
arrival again to the plane of the earth’s motion, the inclination
of the orbit is restored to something more than its first
magnitude, though the difference is not very great, because
the points I and C are not far distant from each other<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>31. <span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> the same manner, if the moon had departed
from the quarter in C, it should have described the curve
line C&nbsp;X&nbsp;W (in fig. 98.) between the planes A&nbsp;F&nbsp;C and A&nbsp;D&nbsp;C,
which would be convex to the former of those planes, and
concave to the latter; so that, here also, the nodes should
continually recede, and the inclination of the orbit gradually
diminish more and more, till the moon arrived near its opposition
to the sun in X; but from that time the inclination
should again increase, till it became a little greater than at first.
This will easily appear, by considering, that as the action of
the sun upon the moon, by exceeding its action upon the earth,
drew it out of the plane A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C towards the sun, while the moon
passed from A to I; so, during its passage from C to W, the
moon being all that time farther from the sun than the earth,
it will be attracted less; and the earth, together with the
plane A&nbsp;E&nbsp;C&nbsp;F, will as it were be drawn from the moon, in
such sort, that the path the moon describes shall appear from
the earth, as it did in the former case by the moon’s being
drawn away.</p>

<p>32. <span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> are the changes, which the nodes and the inclination
of the moon’s orbit undergo, when the nodes are in
the quarters; but when the nodes by their motion, and the
motion of the sun together, come to be situated between the
quarter and conjunction or opposition, their motion and the
change made in the inclination of the orbit are somewhat different.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>33. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Let</span> A&nbsp;G&nbsp;C&nbsp;H (in fig. 103.) be a circle described in the
plane of the earth’s motion, having the earth in T for its center.
Let the point opposite to the sun be A, and the point G a fourth
part of the circle distant from A. Let the nodes of the moon’s
orbit be situated in the line B&nbsp;T&nbsp;D, and B the node, falling between
A, the place where the moon would be in the full,
and G the place where the moon would be in the quarter.
Suppose B&nbsp;E&nbsp;D&nbsp;F to be the plane, in which the moon essays to
move, when it proceeds from the point B. Because the moon
in B is more distant from the sun than the earth, it shall be
less attracted by the sun, and shall not descend towards the
sun so fast as the earth: consequently it shall quit the plane
B&nbsp;E&nbsp;D&nbsp;F, which we suppose to accompany the earth, and describe
the line B&nbsp;I&nbsp;K convex thereto, till such time as it comes
to the point K, where it will be in the quarter: but from
thenceforth being more attracted than the earth, the moon
shall change its course, and the following part of the path
it describes shall be concave to the plane B&nbsp;E&nbsp;D or B&nbsp;G&nbsp;D,
and shall continue concave to the plane B&nbsp;G&nbsp;D, till it crosses
that plane in L, just as in the preceding case.  Now I say,
while the moon is passing from B to K, the nodes, contrary
to what was found in the foregoing case, will proceed forward,
or move the same way with the moon<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>; and at the
same time the inclination of the orbit will increase<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>34. <span class="smcap gesperrt">When</span> the moon is in the point I, let the plane
M&nbsp;I&nbsp;N pass through the earth T, and touch the path of the
moon in I, cutting the plane of the earth’s motion, in the line
M&nbsp;T&nbsp;N, and the plane B&nbsp;E&nbsp;D in the line T&nbsp;O. Because the line
B&nbsp;I&nbsp;K is convex to the plane B&nbsp;E&nbsp;D, which touches it in B, the
plane N&nbsp;I&nbsp;M must cross the plane D&nbsp;E&nbsp;B, before it meets the
plane C&nbsp;G&nbsp;B; and therefore the point M will fall from B towards
G, and the node of the moon’s orbit being translated
from B to M is moved forward.</p>

<p>35. <span class="smcap gesperrt">I say</span> farther, the angle under O&nbsp;M&nbsp;G, which the
plane M&nbsp;O&nbsp;N makes with the plane B&nbsp;G&nbsp;C, is greater than the
angle under O&nbsp;B&nbsp;G, which the plane B&nbsp;O&nbsp;D makes with the
same. This appears from what has been already explained;
because the arches B&nbsp;O, O&nbsp;M are each less than the quarter of
a circle, and therefore taken both together are less than a semicircle.</p>

<p>36. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Again</span>, when the moon is come to the point K in
its quarter, the nodes will be advanced yet farther forward,
and the inclination of the orbit also more augmented. Hitherto
the moon’s motion has been referred to the plane,
which passing through the earth touches the path of the
moon in the point, where the moon is, according to what
was asserted at the beginning of this discourse upon the
nodes, that it is the custom of astronomers so to do. But
here in the point K no such plane can be found; on the contrary,
seeing the line of the moon’s motion on one side the point
K is convex to the plane B&nbsp;E&nbsp;D, and on the other side concave
to the same, no plane can pass through the points T and
K but will cut the line B&nbsp;K&nbsp;L in that point. Therefore instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of such a touching plane, we must here make use of what is
equivalent, the plane P&nbsp;K&nbsp;Q, with which the line B&nbsp;K&nbsp;L shall
make a less angle than with any other plane; for this plane
does as it were touch the line B&nbsp;K in the point K, since it so
cuts it, that no other plane can be drawn so, as to pass between
the line B&nbsp;K and the plane P&nbsp;K&nbsp;Q. But now it is evident,
that the point P, or the node, is removed from M towards
G, that is, has moved yet farther forward; and it is
likewise as manifest, that the angle under K&nbsp;P&nbsp;G, or the inclination
of the moon’s orbit in the point K, is greater than
the angle under I&nbsp;M&nbsp;G, for the reason so often assigned.</p>

<p>37. <span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> the moon has passed the quarter, the path of
the moon being concave to the plane A&nbsp;G&nbsp;C&nbsp;H, the nodes, as
in the preceding case, shall recede, till the moon arrives at
the point L; which shews, that considering the whole time
of the moon’s passing from B to L, at the end of that time the
nodes shall be found to have receded, or to be placed backwarder,
when the moon is in L, than when it was in B. For
the moon takes a longer time in passing from K to L, than
in passing from B to K; and therefore the nodes continue to
recede a longer time, than they moved forwards; so that their
recess must surmount their advance.</p>

<p>38. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the same manner, while the moon is in its passage
from K to L, the inclination of the orbit shall diminish, till
the moon comes to the point, in which it is one quarter
part of a circle distant from its node; suppose in the point
R; and from that time the inclination shall again increase.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Since therefore the inclination of the orbit increases, while
the moon is passing from B to K, and diminishes itself again
only, while the moon is passing from K to R, and then
augments again, till the moon arrive in L; while the moon is
passing from B to L, the inclination of the orbit is much more
increased than diminished, and will be distinguishably greater,
when the moon is come to L, than when it set out from B.</p>

<p>39. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> like manner, while the moon is passing from L on
the other side the plane A&nbsp;G&nbsp;C&nbsp;H, the node shall advance forward,
as long as the moon is between the point L and the next
quarter; but afterwards it shall recede, till the moon come
to pass the plane A&nbsp;G&nbsp;C&nbsp;H again in the point V, between B and
A: and because the time between the moon’s passing from
L to the next quarter is less, than the time between that quarter
and the moon’s coming to the point V, the node shall
have more receded than advanced; so that the point V will
be nearer to A, than L is to C. So also the inclination of the
orbit, when the moon is in V, will be greater, than when the
moon was at L; for this inclination increases all the time the
moon is between L and the next quarter; it decreases only
while the moon is passing from this quarter to the mid way
between the two nodes, and from thence increases again during
the whole passage through the other half of the way to
the next node.</p>

<p>40. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> we have traced the moon from her node in
the quarter, and shewn, that at every period of the moon the
nodes will have receded, and thereby will have approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
toward a conjunction with the sun. But this conjunction will
be much forwarded by the visible motion of the sun itself.
In the last scheme the sun will appear to move from S toward
W. Suppose it appeared to have moved from S to W,
while the moon’s node has receded from B to V, then drawing
the line W&nbsp;T&nbsp;X, the arch V&nbsp;X will represent the distance of the
line drawn between the nodes from the sun, when the moon
is in V; whereas the arch B&nbsp;A represented that distance, when
the moon was in B. This visible motion of the sun is much
greater, than that of the node; for the sun appears to revolve
quite round each year, and the node is near 19 years in making
one revolution. We have also seen, that when the node
was in the quadrature, the inclination of the moon’s orbit decreased,
till the moon came to the conjunction, or opposition,
according to which node it set out from; but that afterwards
it again increased, till it became at the next node rather
greater than at the former. When the node is once removed
from the quarter nearer to a conjunction with the sun,
the inclination of the moon’s orbit, when the moon comes
into the node, is more sensibly greater, than it was in the node
preceding; the inclination of the orbit by this means more
and more increasing till the node comes into conjunction with
the sun; at which time it has been shewn above, that the sun
has no power to change the plane of the moon’s motion; and
consequently has no effect either on the nodes, or on the inclination
of the orbit.</p>

<p>41. <span class="smcap gesperrt">As</span> soon as the nodes, by the action of the sun, are
got out of conjunction toward the other quarters, they begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
again to recede as before; but the inclination of the orbit in
the appulse of the moon to each succeeding node is less than
at the preceding, till the nodes come again into the quarters.
This will appear as follows. Let A (in fig. 104.) represent
one of the moon’s nodes placed between the point
of opposition B and the quarter C. Let the plane A&nbsp;D&nbsp;E pass
through the earth T, and touch the path of the moon in A.
Let the line A&nbsp;F&nbsp;G&nbsp;H be the path of the moon in her passage
from A to H, where she crosses again the plane of the earth’s
motion. This line will be convex toward the plane A&nbsp;D&nbsp;E, till
the moon comes to G, where she is in the quarter; and after
this, between G and H, the same line will be concave toward
this plane. All the time this line is convex toward the plane
A&nbsp;D&nbsp;E, the nodes will recede; and on the contrary proceed,
while it is concave to that plane. All this will easily be conceived
from what has been before so largely explained. But
the moon is longer in passing from A to G, than from G to H;
therefore the nodes recede a longer time, than they proceed;
consequently upon the whole, when the moon is arrived at
H, the nodes will have receded, that is, the point H will fall
between B and E. The inclination of the orbit will decrease,
till the moon is arrived to the point F, in the middle between
A and H. Through the passage between F and G the inclination
will increase, but decrease again in the remaining part
of the passage from G to H, and consequently at H must be
less than at A. The like effects, both in respect to the nodes
and inclination of the orbit, will take place in the following
passage of the moon on the other side of the plane A&nbsp;B&nbsp;E&nbsp;C,
from H, till it comes over that plane again in I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>42. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> the inclination of the orbit is greatest, when
the line drawn between the moon’s nodes will pass through
the sun; and least, when this line lies in the quarters, especially
if the moon at the same time be in conjunction with the
sun, or in the opposition. In the first of these cases the nodes
have no motion, in all others, the nodes will each month
have receded: and this regressive motion will be greatest,
when the nodes are in the quarters; for in that case the nodes
have no progressive motion during the whole month, but in
all other cases the nodes do at some times proceed forward,
viz. whenever the moon is between either quarter, and the
node which is less distant from that quarter than a fourth
part of a circle.</p>

<p><a name="c218" id="c218">43.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> now remains only to explain the irregularities in
the moon’s motion, which follow from the elliptical figure
of the orbit. By what has been said at the beginning of this
chapter it appears, that the power of the earth on the moon
acts in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the distance:
therefore the moon, if undisturbed by the sun, would move
round the earth in a true ellipsis, and the line drawn from
the earth to the moon would pass over equal spaces in equal
portions of time. That this description of the spaces is
altered by the sun, has been already declared. It has also
been shown, that the figure of the orbit is changed each
month; that the moon is nearer the earth at the new and
full, and more remote in the quarters, than it would be without
the sun. Now we must pass by these monthly changes,
and consider the effect, which the sun will have in the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
situations of the axis of the orbit in respect of that luminary.</p>

<p>44. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> action of the sun varies the force, wherewith
the moon is drawn toward the earth; in the quarters the
force of the earth is directly increased by the sun; at the
new and full the same is diminished; and in the intermediate
places the influence of the earth is sometimes aided, and
sometimes lessened by the sun. In these intermediate places
between the quarters and the conjunction or opposition,
the sun’s action is so oblique to the action of the earth on
the moon, as to produce that alternate acceleration and retardment
of the moon’s motion, which I observed above
to be stiled the variation. But besides this effect, the power,
by which the earth attracts the moon toward itself, will not
be at full liberty to act with the same force, as if the sun
acted not at all on the moon. And this effect of the sun’s
action, whereby it corroborates or weakens the action of the
earth, is here only to be considered. And by this influence
of the sun it comes to pass, that the power, by which the
moon is impelled toward the earth, is not perfectly in the reciprocal
duplicate proportion of the distance. Consequently
the moon will not describe a perfect ellipsis. One particular,
wherein the moon’s orbit will differ from an ellipsis, consists
in the places, where the motion of the moon is perpendicular
to the line drawn from itself to the earth. In an
ellipsis, after the moon should have set out in the direction
perpendicular to this line drawn from itself to the earth,
and at its greatest distance from the earth, its motion would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
again become perpendicular to this line drawn between itself
and the earth, and the moon be at its nearest distance
from the earth, when it should have performed half its period;
after performing the other half of its period its motion
would again become perpendicular to the forementioned
line, and the moon return into the place whence it set out,
and have recovered again its greatest distance. But the moon
in its real motion, after setting out as before, sometimes makes
more than half a revolution, before its motion comes again
to be perpendicular to the line drawn from itself to the earth,
and the moon is at its nearest distance; and then performs
more than another half of an intire revolution before its motion
can a second time recover its perpendicular direction to
the line drawn from the moon to the earth, and the moon
arrive again to its greatest distance from the earth. At other
times the moon will descend to its nearest distance, before it
has made half a revolution, and recover again its greatest distance,
before it has made an intire revolution. The place,
where the moon is at its greatest distance from the earth, is called
the moon’s apogeon, and the place of the least distance
the perigeon. This change of the place, where the moon
successively comes to its greatest distance from the earth, is
called the motion of the apogeon. In what manner the sun
causes the apogeon to move, I shall now endeavour to explain.</p>

<p>45. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> author shews, that if the moon were attracted
toward the earth by a composition of two powers, one
of which were reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of
the distance from the earth, and the other reciprocally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in the triplicate proportion of the same distance; then,
though the line described by the moon would not be in
reality an ellipsis, yet the moon’s motion might be perfectly
explained by an ellipsis, whose axis should be made to move
round the earth; this motion being in consequence, as astronomers
express themselves, that is, the same way as the moon
itself moves, if the moon be attracted by the sum of the two
powers; but the axis must move in antecedence, or the contrary
way, if the moon be acted on by the difference of these
powers. What is meant by duplicate proportion has been
often explained; namely, that if three magnitudes, as A, B,
and C, are so related, that the second B bears the same proportion
to the third C, as the first A bears to the second
B, then the proportion of the first A to the third C, is the
duplicate of the proportion of the first A to the second B.
Now if a fourth magnitude, as D, be assumed, to which C
shall bear the same proportion as A bears to B, and B to C,
then the proportion of A to D is the triplicate of the proportion
of A to B.</p>

<p>46. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> way of representing the moon’s motion in
this case is thus. T denoting the earth (in fig. 105, 106.)
suppose the moon in the point A, its apogeon, or greatest
distance from the earth, moving in the direction A&nbsp;F perpendicular
to A&nbsp;B, and acted upon from the earth by two
such forces as have been named. By that power alone,
which is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of the
distance, if the moon let out from the point A with a
proper degree of velocity, the ellipsis A&nbsp;M&nbsp;B may be described.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
But if the moon be acted upon by the sum of the
forementioned powers, and the velocity of the moon in the
point A be augmented in a certain proportion<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>; or if that
velocity be diminished in a certain proportion, and the moon
be acted upon by the difference of those powers; in both
these cases the line A&nbsp;E, which shall be described by the
moon, is thus to be determined. Let the point M be that,
into which the moon would have arrived in any given space
of time, had it moved in the ellipsis A&nbsp;M&nbsp;B. Draw M&nbsp;T,
and likewise C&nbsp;T&nbsp;D in such sort, that the angle under A&nbsp;T&nbsp;M
shall bear the same proportion to the angle under A&nbsp;T&nbsp;C, as
the velocity, with which the ellipsis A&nbsp;M&nbsp;B must have been described,
bears to the difference between this velocity, and the
velocity, with which the moon must set out from the point A
in order to describe the path A&nbsp;E. Let the angle A&nbsp;T&nbsp;C be taken
toward the moon (as in fig. 105.) if the moon be attracted
by the sum of the powers; but the contrary way (as in
fig. 106.) if by their difference. Then let the line A&nbsp;B be
moved into the position C&nbsp;D, and the ellipsis A&nbsp;M&nbsp;B into the
situation C&nbsp;N&nbsp;D, so that the point M be translated to L: then
the point L shall fall upon the path of the moon A&nbsp;E.</p>

<p>47. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> angular motion of the line A&nbsp;T, wereby it is
removed into the situation C&nbsp;T, represents the motion of the
apogeon; by the means of which the motion of the moon
might be fully explicated by the ellipsis A&nbsp;M&nbsp;B, if the action of
the sun upon it was directed to the center of the earth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
reciprocally in the triplicate proportion of the moon’s distance
from it. But that not being so, the apogeon will not move in
the regular manner now described. However, it is to be observed
here, that in the first of the two preceding cases, where
the apogeon moves forward, the whole centripetal power
increases faster, with the decrease of distance, than if the
intire power were reciprocally in the duplicate proportion of
the distance; because one part only is in that proportion,
and the other part, which is added to this to make up the
whole power, increases faster with the decrease of distance.
On the other hand, when the centripetal power is the difference
between these two, it increases less with the decrease of
the distance, than if it were simply in the reciprocal duplicate
proportion of the distance. Therefore if we chuse to explain
the moon’s motion by an ellipsis (as is most convenient
for astronomical uses to be done, and by reason of the small
effect of the sun’s power, the doing so will not be attended
with any sensible error;) we may collect in general, that
when the power, by which the moon is attracted to the earth,
by varying the distance, increases in a greater than in the duplicate
proportion of the distance diminished, a motion in consequence
must be ascribed to the apogeon; but that when the
attraction increases in a less proportion than that named, the
apogeon must have given to it a motion in antecedence<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>. It is
then observed by Sir <span class="smcap">Is. Newton</span>, that the first of these cases
obtains, when the moon is in the conjunction and opposition;
and the latter, when the moon is in the quarters: so that
in the first the apogeon moves according to the order of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
signs; in the other, the contrary way<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>. But, as was said before,
the disturbance given to the action of the earth by the sun in
the conjunction and opposition being near twice as great as
in the quarters<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>, the apogeon will advance with a greater
velocity than recede, and in the compass of a whole revolution
of the moon will be carried in consequence<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>.</p>

<p>48. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is shewn in the next place by our author, that
when the line A&nbsp;B coincides with that, which joins the earth
and the sun, the progressive motion of the apogeon, when
the moon is in the conjunction or opposition, exceeds the
regressive in the quadratures more than in any other situation
of the line A&nbsp;B<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>. On the contrary, when the line A&nbsp;B
makes right angles with that, which joins the earth and sun,
the retrograde motion will be more considerable<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>, nay is
found so great as to exceed the progressive; so that in this
case the apogeon in the compass of an intire revolution of
the moon is carried in antecedence. Yet from the considerations
in the last paragraph the progressive motion exceeds
the other; so that in the whole the mean motion of
the apogeon is in consequence, according as astronomers
find. Moreover, the line A&nbsp;B changes its situation with that,
which joins the earth and sun, by such slow degrees, that the
inequalities in the motion of the apogeon arising from this
last consideration, are much greater than what arises from
the other<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>49. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Farther</span>, this unsteady motion in the apogeon is attended
with another inequality in the motion of the moon, that
it cannot be explained at all times by the same ellipsis. The
ellipsis in general is called by astronomers an eccentric orbit.
The point, in which the two axis’s cross, is called the center of
the figure; because all lines drawn through this point within
the ellipsis, from side to side, are divided in the middle by
this point. But the center, about which the heavenly bodies
revolve, lying out of this center of the figure in one focus,
these orbits are said to be eccentric; and where the distance of
the focus from this center bears the greatest proportion to the
whole axis, that orbit is called the most eccentric: and in
such an orbit the distance from the focus to the remoter extremity
of the axis bears the greatest proportion to the distance
of the nearer extremity. Now whenever the apogeon
of the moon moves in consequence, the moon’s motion
must be referred to an orbit more eccentric, than what the
moon would describe, if the whole power, by which the
moon was acted on in its passing from the apogeon, changed
according to the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the distance
from the earth, and by that means the moon did describe
an immoveable ellipsis; and when the apogeon moves
in antecedence, the moon’s motion must be referred to an
orbit less eccentric. In the first of the two figures last referred
to, the true place of the moon L falls without the orbit
A&nbsp;M&nbsp;B, to which its motion is referred: whence the orbit A&nbsp;L&nbsp;E,
truly described by the moon, is less incurvated in the point A,
than is the orbit A&nbsp;M&nbsp;B; therefore the orbit A&nbsp;M&nbsp;B is more oblong,
and differs farther from a circle, than the ellipsis would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
whose curvature in A were equal to that of the line A&nbsp;L&nbsp;B,
that is, the proportion of the distance of the earth T from
the center of the ellipsis to its axis will be greater in the ellipsis
A&nbsp;M&nbsp;B, than in the other; but that other is the ellipsis,
which the moon would describe, if the power acting upon it
in the point A were altered in the reciprocal duplicate proportion
of the distance. In the second figure, when the
apogeon recedes, the place of the moon L falls within the
orbit A&nbsp;M&nbsp;B, and therefore that orbit is less eccentric, than
the immoveable orbit which the moon should describe. The
truth of this is evident; for, when the apogeon moves forward,
the power, by which the moon is influenced in its descent
from the apogeon, increases faster with the decrease of
distance, than in the duplicate proportion of the distance;
and consequently the moon being drawn more forcibly toward
the earth, it will descend nearer to it. On the other
hand, when the apogeon recedes, the power acting on the
moon increases with the decrease of distance in less than the
duplicate proportion of the distance; and therefore the moon
is less impelled toward the earth, and will not descend so low.</p>

<p>50. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> suppose in the first of these figures, that the
apogeon A is in the situation, where it is approaching toward
the conjunction or opposition of the sun. In this case the progressive
motion of the apogeon is more and more accelerated.
Here suppose that the moon, after having descended from A
through the orbit A&nbsp;E as far as F, where it is come to its nearest
distance from the earth, ascends again up the line F&nbsp;G. Because
the motion of the apogeon is here continually more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
more accelerating, the cause of its motion is constantly upon
the increase; that is, the power, whereby the moon is
drawn to the earth, will decrease with the increase of distance,
in the moon’s ascent from F, in a greater proportion than that
wherewith it increased with the decrease of distance in the
moon’s descent to F. Consequently the moon will ascend higher
than to the distance A&nbsp;T, from whence it descended; therefore
the proportion of the greatest distance of the moon to
the least is increased. And when the moon descends again, the
power will yet more increase with the decrease of distance,
than in the last ascent it decreased with the augmentation
of distance; the moon therefore must descend nearer to the
earth than it did before, and the proportion of the greatest
distance to the least yet be more increased. Thus as long
as the apogeon is advancing toward the conjunction or opposition,
the proportion of the greatest distance of the moon
from the earth to the least will continually increase; and
the elliptical orbit, to which the moon’s motion is referred,
will be rendered more and more eccentric.</p>

<p>51. <span class="smcap gesperrt">As</span> soon as the apogeon is passed the conjunction
with the sun or the opposition, the progressive motion thereof
abates, and with it the proportion of the greatest distance of
the moon from the earth to the least distance will also diminish;
and when the apogeon becomes regressive, the diminution
of this proportion will be still farther continued on, till
the apogeon comes into the quarter; from thence this proportion,
and the eccentricity of the orbit will increase again.
Thus the orbit of the moon is most eccentric, when the apogeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
is in conjunction with the sun, or in opposition to it,
and least of all when the apogeon is in the quarters.</p>

<p>52. <span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> changes in the nodes, in the inclination of
the orbit to the plane of the earth’s motion, in the apogeon,
and in the eccentricity, are varied like the other inequalities
in the motion of the moon, by the different distance of the
earth from the sun; being greatest, when their cause is greatest,
that is, when the earth is nearest to the sun.</p>

<p>53. <span class="smcap gesperrt">I said</span> at the beginning of this chapter, that Sir <span class="smcap">Isaac
Newton</span> has computed the very quantity of many of the
moon’s inequalities. That acceleration of the moon’s motion,
which is called the variation, when greatest, removes
the moon out of the place, in which it would otherwise be
found, something more than half a degree<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. In the phrase
of astronomers, a degree is 1/360 part of the whole circuit of
the moon or any planet. If the moon, without disturbance
from the sun, would have described a circle concentrical to
the earth, the sun will cause the moon to approach nearer
to the earth in the conjunction and opposition, than in the
quarters, nearly in the proportion of 69 to 70<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>. We had
occasion to mention above, that the nodes perform their period
in almost 19 years. This the astronomers found by
observation; and our author’s computations assign to them
the same period<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. The inclination of the moon’s orbit when
least, is an angle about 1/18 part of that angle, which constitutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
a perpendicular; and the difference between the greatest and
least inclination of the orbit is determined by our author’s
computation to be about 1/18 of the least inclination<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>. And
this also is agreeable to the observations of astronomers. The
motion of the apogeon, and the changes in the eccentricity,
Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> has not computed. The apogeon
performs its revolution in about eight years and ten months.
When the moon’s orbit is most eccentric, the greatest distance
of the moon from the earth bears to the least distance
nearly the proportion of 8 to 7; when the orbit is
least eccentric, this proportion is hardly so great as that of
12 to 11.</p>

<p><a name="c229" id="c229">54.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Sir</span> <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Isaac Newton</em></span> shews farther, how, by comparing
the periods of the motion of the satellites, which revolve
round Jupiter and Saturn, with the period of our
moon round the earth, and the periods of those planets
round the sun with the period of our earth’s motion, the
inequalities in the motion of those satellites may be derived
from the inequalities in the moon’s motion; excepting only
in regard to that motion of the axis of the orbit, which
in the moon makes the motion of the apogeon; for the
orbits of those satellites, as far as can be discerned by us at
this distance, appearing little or nothing eccentric, this
motion, as deduced from the moon, must be diminished.</p>

Of <em class="gesperrt">Comets</em>.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN the former of the two preceding chapters the powers
have been explained, which keep in motion those celestial
bodies, whose courses had been well determined by the
astronomers. In the last chapter we have shewn, how those
powers have been applied by our author to the making a
more perfect discovery of the motion of those bodies, the
courses of which were but imperfectly understood; for
some of the inequalities, which we have been describing
in the moon’s motion, were unknown to the astronomers.
In this chapter we are to treat of a third species of the heavenly
bodies, the true motion of which was not at all apprehended
before our author writ; in so much, that here
Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> has not only explained the causes of
the motion of these bodies, but has performed also the part
of an astronomer, by discovering what their motions are.</p>

<p><a name="c230b" id="c230b">2.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">That</span> these bodies are not meteors in our air, is
manifest; because they rise and set in the same manner,
as the sun and stars. The astronomers had gone so far in
their inquiries concerning them, as to prove by their observations,
that they moved in the etherial spaces far beyond
the moon; but they had no true notion at all of the path,
which they described. The most prevailing opinion before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
our author was, that they moved in straight lines; but in
what part of the heavens was not determined. <span class="smcap">DesCartes</span><a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
removed them far beyond the sphere of Saturn, as
finding the straight motion attributed to them, inconsistent
with the vortical fluid, by which he explains the motions
of the planets, as we have above related<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>. But Sir <span class="smcap">Isaac
Newton</span> distinctly proves from astronomical observation,
that the comets pass through the region of the planets, and
are mostly invisible at a less distance, than that of Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c231" id="c231">3.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">And</span> from hence finding the comets to be evidently
within the sphere of the sun’s action, he concludes they
must, necessarily move about the sun, as the planets do<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>.
The planets move in ellipsis’s; but it is not necessary that
every body, which is influenced by the sun, should move
in that particular kind of line. However our author proves,
that the power of the sun being reciprocally in the duplicate
proportion of the distance, every body acted on by the sun
must either fall directly down, or move in some conic section;
of which lines I have above observed, that there are
three species, the ellipsis, parabola, and hyperbola<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. If a
body, which descends toward the sun as low as the orbit
of any planet, move with a swifter motion than the planet
does, that body will describe an orbit of a more oblong
figure, than that of the planet, and have a longer axis at
least.  The velocity of the body may be so great, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
shall move in a parabola, and having once passed about
the sun, shall ascend for ever without returning any more:
but the sun will be placed in the focus of this parabola.
With a velocity still greater the body will move in an
hyperbola. But it is most probable, that the comets move
in elliptical orbits, though of a very oblong, or in the
phrase of astronomers, of a very eccentric form, such as
is represented in fig. 107, where S is the sun, C the comet,
and A&nbsp;B&nbsp;D&nbsp;E its orbit, wherein the distance of S
and D far exceeds that of S and A. Whence it is, that
they sometimes are found at a moderate distance from the
sun, and appear within the planetary regions; at other
times they ascend to vast distances, far beyond the very orbit
of Saturn, and so become invisible.  That the comets
do move in this manner is proved by our author, from computations
built upon the observations, which astronomers had
made on many comets. These computations were performed
by Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> himself upon the comet, which
appeared toward the latter end of the year 1680, and at
the beginning of the year following<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>; but the learned
Dr. <span class="smcap">Halley</span> prosecuted the like computations more at large
in this, and also in many other comets<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. Which computations
are made upon propositions highly worthy of our author’s unparallel’d
genius, such as could scarce have been discovered
by any one not possessed of the utmost force of invention;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="c233" id="c233">4.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Those</span> computations depend upon this principle,
that the eccentricity of the orbits of the comets is so
great, that if they are really elliptical, yet they approach
so near to parabolas in that part of them, where they
come under our view, that they may be taken for such
without sensible error<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>: as in the preceding figure the
parabola F&nbsp;A&nbsp;G differs in the lower part of it about A very
little from the ellipsis D&nbsp;E&nbsp;A&nbsp;B. Upon which ground
our great author teaches a method of finding by three observations
made upon any comet the parabola, which
nearest agrees with its orbit<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> what confirms this whole theory beyond the
least room for doubt is, that the places of the comets computed
in the orbits, which the method here mentioned
assigns them, agree to the observations of astronomers with
the same degree of exactness, as the computations of the
primary planets places usually do; and this in comets,
whose motions are very extraordinary<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> author afterwards shews how to make use of
any small deviation from the parabola, that shall be observed,
to determine whether the orbits of the comets are
elliptical or not, and so to discover if the same comet returns
at certain periods<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>. And upon examining the comet
in 1680, by the rule laid down for this purpose, he
finds its orbit to agree more exactly to an ellipsis than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to a parabola, though the ellipsis be so very eccentric,
that the comet cannot perform its period through it in the
space of 500 years<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>. Upon this Dr. <span class="smcap">Halley</span> observed,
that mention is made in history of a comet, with the
like eminent tail as this, having appeared three several
times before; the first of which appearances was at the
death of <span class="smcap">Julius Cesar</span>, and each appearance was at the
distance of 575 years from the next preceding. He therefore
computed the motion of this comet in such an elliptic
orbit, as would require this number of years for the
body to revolve through it; and these computations agree
yet more perfectly with the observations made on this comet,
than any parabolical orbit will do<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c234" id="c234">7.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> comparing together different appearances of the
same comet, is the only way to discover certainly the true
form of the orbit: for it is impossible to determine with exactness
the figure of an orbit so exceedingly eccentric, from
single observations taken in one part of it; and therefore
Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em><a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> proposes to compare the orbits,
upon the supposition that they are parabolical, of such
comets as appear at different times; for if the same orbit
be found to be described by a comet at different times,
in all probability it will be the same comet which describes
it. And here he remarks from Dr. <span class="smcap">Halley</span>, that
the same orbit very nearly agrees to two appearances of
a comet about the space of 75 years distance<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>; so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
if those two appearances were really of the same comet,
the transverse axis of the orbit of the comet would be near
18 times the axis of the earth’s orbit; and the comet,
when at its greatest distance from the sun, will be removed
not less than 35 times as far as the middle distance
of the earth.</p>

<p><a name="c235" id="c235">8.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">And</span> this seems to be the shortest period of any of
the comets. But it will be farther confirmed, if the same
comet should return a third time after another period of
75 years. However it is not to be expected, that comets
should preserve the same regularity in their periods, as
the planets; because the great eccentricity of their orbits
makes them liable to suffer very considerable alterations
from the action of the planets, and other comets, upon them.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is therefore to prevent too great disturbances
in their motions from these causes, as our author observes,
that while the planets revolve all of them nearly in the
same plane, the comets are disposed in very different ones;
and distributed over all parts of the heavens; that,
when in their greatest distance from the sun, and moving
slowest, they might be removed as far as possible out of the
reach of each other’s action<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. The same end is likewise
farther answered in those comets, which by moving slowest
in the aphelion, or remotest distance from the sun, descend
nearest to it, by placing the aphelion of these at the
greatest height from the sun<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> philosopher being led by his principles to explain
the motions of the comets, in the manner now related,
takes occasion from thence to give us his thoughts
upon their nature and use.  For which end he proves in
the first place, that they must necessarily be solid and compact
bodies, and by no means any sort of vapour or light
substance exhaled from the planets or stars: because at
the near distance, to which some comets approach the sun,
it could not be, but the immense heat, to which they are
exposed, should instantaneously disperse and scatter any
such light volatile substance<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>. In particular the forementioned
comet of 1680 descended so near the sun, as to
come within a sixth part of the sun’s diameter from the
surface of it. In which situation it must have been exposed,
as appears by computation, to a degree of heat
exceeding the heat of the sun upon our earth no less than
28000 times; and therefore might have contracted a degree
of heat 2000 times greater, than that of red hot
iron<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>. Now a substance, which could endure so intense
a heat, without being dispersed in vapor, must needs be
firm and solid.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is shewn likewise, that the comets are opake
substances, shining by a reflected light, borrowed from
the sun<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>. This is proved from the observation, that comets,
though they are approaching the earth, yet diminish
in lustre, if at the same time they recede from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the sun; and on the contrary, are found to encrease
daily in brightness, when they advance towards the sun,
though at the same time they move from the earth<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> comets therefore in these respects resemble the
planets; that both are durable opake bodies, and both revolve
about the sun in conic sections. But farther the
comets, like our earth, are surrounded by an atmosphere.
The air we breath is called the earth’s atmosphere;
and it is most probable, that all the other planets
are invested with the like fluid. Indeed here a difference
is found between the planets and comets. The atmospheres
of the planets are of so fine and subtile a substance, as
hardly to be discerned at any distance, by reason of the
small quantity of light which they reflect, except only in
the planet Mars. In him there is some little appearance
of such a substance surrounding him, as stars which have
been covered by him are said to look somewhat dim a
small space before his body comes under them, as if their
light, when he is near, were obstructed by his atmosphere.
But the atmospheres which surround the comets are so
gross and thick, as to reflect light very copiously. They
are also much greater in proportion to the body they surround,
than those of the planets, if we may judge of
the rest from our air; for it has been observed of comets,
that the bright light appearing in the middle of them, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
is reflected from the solid body, is scarce a ninth or tenth
part of the whole comet,</p>

<p><a name="c238" id="c238">13.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">I speak</span> only of the heads of the comets, the most
lucid part of which is surrounded by a fainter light, the
most lucid part being usually not above a ninth or tenth
part of the whole in breadth<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>. Their tails are an appearance
very peculiar, nothing of the same nature appertaining
in the least degree to any other of the celestial bodies.
Of that appearance there are several opinions; our
author reduces them to three<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>. The two first, which he
proposes, are rejected by him; but the third he approves.
The first is, that they arise from a beam of light transmitted
through the head of the comet, in like manner as
a stream of light is discerned, when the sun shines into a
darkened room through a small hole. This opinion, as
Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> observes, implies the authors of it
wholly unskilled in the principles of optics; for that stream
of light, seen in a darkened room, arises from the reflection
of the sun beams by the dust and motes floating in
the air: for the rays of light themselves are not seen, but
by their being reflected to the eye from some substance,
upon which they fall<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>. The next opinion examined by
our author is that of the celebrated <span class="smcap">DesCartes</span>, who
imagins these tails to be the light of the comet refracted
in its passage to us, and thence affording an oblong representation;
as the light of the sun does, when refracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
by the prism in that noted experiment, which will have a
great share in the third book of this discourse<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>. But this
opinion is at once overturned from this consideration only,
that the planets could be no more free from this refraction
than the comets; nay ought to have larger or
brighter tails, than they, because the light of the planets is
strongest. However our author has thought proper to add
some farther objections against this opinion: for instance,
that these tails are not variegated with colours, as is the
image produced by the prism, and which is inseparable
from that unequal refraction, which produces that disproportioned
length of the image. And besides, when the
light in its passage from different comets to the earth describes
the same path through the heavens, the refraction
of it should of necessity be in all respects the same. But
this is contrary to observation; for the comet in 1680,
the 28th day of December, and a former comet in the
year 1577, the 29th day of December, appear’d in the
same place of the heavens, that is, were seen adjacent to
the same fixed stars, the earth likewise being in the same
place at both times; yet the tail of the latter comet deviated
from the opposition to the sun a little to the northward,
and the tail of the former comet declined from the
opposition of the sun five times as much southward<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> are some other false opinions, though less
regarded than these, which have been advanced upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
argument. These our excellent author passes over, hastening
to explain, what he takes to be the true cause of this
appearance. He thinks it is certainly owing to steams and
vapours exhaled from the body, and gross atmosphere of
the comets, by the heat of the sun; because all the appearances
agree perfectly to this sentiment. The tails are
but small, while the comet is descending to the sun, but
enlarge themselves to an immense degree, as soon as ever
the comet has passed its perihelion; which shews the tail
to depend upon the degree of heat, which the comet receives
from the sun. And that the intense heat to which
comets, when nearest the sun, are exposed, should exhale
from them a very copious vapour, is a most reasonable supposition;
especially if we consider, that in those free and
empty regions steams will more easily ascend, than here
upon the surface of the earth, where they are suppressed
and hindered from rising by the weight of the incumbent
air: as we find by experiments made in vessels exhausted
of the air, where upon removal of the air several substances
will fume and discharge steams plentifully, which
emit none in the open air. The tails of comets, like such
a vapour, are always in the plane of the comet’s orbit, and
opposite to the sun, except that the upper part thereof
inclines towards the parts, which the comet has left by its
motion; resembling perfectly the smoak of a burning coal,
which, if the coal remain fixed, ascends from it perpendicularly;
but, if the coal be in motion, ascends obliquely,
inclining from the motion of the coal. And besides, the
tails of comets may be compared to this smoak in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
respect, that both of them are denser and more compact
on the convex side, than on the concave. The different
appearance of the head of the comet, after it has past its
perihelion, from what it had before, confirms greatly this
opinion of their tails: for smoke raised by a strong heat is
blacker and grosser, than when raised by a less; and accordingly
the heads of comets, at the same distance from
the sun, are observed less bright and shining after the perihelion,
than before, as if obscured by such a gross smoke.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> observations of <span class="smcap">Hevelius</span> upon the atmospheres
of comets still farther illustrate the same; who relates,
that the atmospheres, especially that part of them next
the sun, are remarkably contracted when near the sun, and
dilated again afterwards.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap gesperrt">To</span> give a more full idea of these tails, a rule is
laid down by our author, whereby to determine at any
time, when the vapour in the extremity of the tail first
rose from the head of the comet. By this rule it is found,
that the tail does not consist of a fleeting vapour, dissipated
soon after it is raised, but is of long continuance;
that almost all the vapour, which rose about the time of
the perihelion from the comet of 1680, continued to accompany
it, ascending by degrees, being succeeded constantly
by fresh matter, which rendered the tail contiguous
to the comet. From this computation the tails are
found to participate of another property of ascending vapours,
that, when they ascend with the greatest velocity,
they are least incurvated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> only objection that can be made against this
opinion is the difficulty of explaining, how a sufficient
quantity of vapour can be raised from the atmosphere of a
comet to fill those vast spaces, through which their tails
are sometimes extended. This our author removes by the
following computation: our air being an elastic fluid, as
has been said before<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>, is more dense here near the surface
of the earth, where it is pressed upon by the whole air
above; than it is at a distance from the earth, where it has
a less weight incumbent. I have observed, that the density
of the air is reciprocally proportional to the compressing
weight. From hence our author computes to what degree
of rarity the air must be expanded, according to this rule, at
an height equal to a semidiameter of the earth: and he finds,
that a globe of such air, as we breath here on the surface of
the earth, which shall be one inch only in diameter, if it were
expanded to the degree of rarity, which the air must have
at the height now mentioned, would fill all the planetary
regions even to the very sphere of Saturn, and far beyond.
Now since the air at a greater height will be still immensly
more rarified, and the surface of the atmospheres
of comets is usually about ten times the distance from the
center of the comet, as the surface of the comet it self, and
the tails are yet vastly farther removed from the center of
the comet; the vapour, which composes those tails, may very
well be allowed to be so expanded, as that a moderate
quantity of matter may fill all that space, they are seen to
take up. Though indeed the atmospheres of comets being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
very gross, they will hardly be rarified in their tails to so great
a degree, as our air under the same circumstances; especially
since they may be something condensed, as well by their gravitation
to the sun, as that the parts will gravitate to one another;
which will hereafter be shewn to be the universal property
of all matter<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>. The only scruple left is, how so much
light can be reflected from a vapour so rare, as this computation
implies. For the removal of which our author observes,
that the most refulgent of these tails hardly appear brighter,
than a beam of the sun’s light transmitted into a darkened
room through a hole of a single inch diameter; and that
the smallest fixed stars are visible through them without any
sensible diminution of their lustre.</p>

<p><a name="c243" id="c243">18.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">All</span> these considerations put it beyond doubt, what
is the true nature of the tails of comets. There has indeed
nothing been said, which will account for the irregular
figures, in which those tails are sometimes reported to have
appeared; but since none of those appearances have ever been
recorded by astronomers, who on the contrary ascribe the
same likeness to the tails of all comets, our author with great
judgment refers all those to accidental refractions by intervening
clouds, or to parts of the milky way contiguous to the
comets<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.</p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> discussion of this appearance in comets has
led Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> into some speculations relating
to their use, which I cannot but extreamly admire, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
representing in the strongest light imaginable the extensive
providence of the great author of nature, who,
besides the furnishing this globe of earth, and without
doubt the rest of the planets, so abundantly with every
thing necessary for the support and continuance of the
numerous races of plants and animals, they are stocked
with, has over and above provided a numerous train of
comets, far exceeding the number of the planets, to rectify
continually, and restore their gradual decay, which
is our author’s opinion concerning them<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>. For since the
comets are subject to such unequal degrees of heat, being
sometimes burnt with the most intense degree of it, at
other times scarce receiving any sensible influence from the
sun; it can hardly be supposed, they are designed for any
such constant use, as the planets. Now the tails, which they
emit, like all other kinds of vapour, dilate themselves as
they ascend, and by consequence are gradually dispersed and
scattered through all the planetary regions, and thence cannot
but be gathered up by the planets, as they pass through
their orbs: for the planets having a power to cause all bodies
to gravitate towards them, as will in the sequel of this
discourse be shewn<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>; these vapours will be drawn in process
of time into this or the other planet, which happens to
act strongest upon them. And by entering the atmospheres
of the earth and other planets, they may well be supposed to
contribute to the renovation of the face of things, in particular
to supply the diminution caused in the humid parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
by vegetation and putrefaction. For vegetables are nourished
by moisture, and by putrefaction are turned in great
part into dry earth; and an earthy substance always subsides
in fermenting liquors; by which means the dry parts
of the planets must continually increase, and the fluids diminish,
nay in a sufficient length of time be exhausted,
if not supplied by some such means. It is farther our great
author’s opinion, that the most subtile and active parts of
our air, upon which the life of things chiefly depends, is
derived to us, and supplied by the comets. So far are
they from portending any hurt or mischief to us, which
the natural fears of men are so apt to suggest from the appearance
of any thing uncommon and astonishing.</p>

<p><a name="c245" id="c245">20.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">That</span> the tails of comets have some such important
use seems reasonable, if we consider, that those bodies
do not send out those fumes merely by their near approach
to the sun; but are framed of a texture, which disposes
them in a particular manner to fume in that sort: for the
earth, without emitting any such steam, is more than half
the year at a less distance from the sun, than the comet
of 1664 and 1665 approached it, when nearest; likewise
the comets of 1682 and 1683 never approached the sun
much above a seventh part nearer than Venus, and were
more than half as far again from the sun as Mercury; yet
all these emitted tails.</p>

<p>21. <span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> the very near approach of the comet of
1680 our author draws another speculation; for if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
sun have an atmosphere about it, the comet mentioned
seems to have descended near enough to the sun to enter
within it. If so, it must have been something retarded by
the resistance it would meet with, and consequently in its
next descent to the sun will fall nearer than now; by
which means it will meet with a greater resistance, and
be again more retarded. The event of which must be, that
at length it will impinge upon the sun’s surface, and thereby
supply any decrease, which may have happened by so long
an emission of light, or otherwise. And something like this
our author conjectures may be the case of those fixed stars
which by an additional increase of their lustre have for a
certain time become visible to us, though usually they are
out of sight. There is indeed a kind of fixed stars, which
appear and disappear at regular and equal intervals: here
some more steady cause must be sought for; perhaps these
stars turn round their own axis’s, as our sun does<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>, and have
some part of their body more luminous than the other,
whereby they are seen, when the most lucid part is next to
us, and when the darker part is turned toward us, they
vanish out of sight.</p>


<p>22. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Whether</span> the sun does really diminish, as has been
here suggested, is difficult to prove; yet that it either does
so, or that the earth increases, if not both, is rendered probable
from Dr. <span class="smcap">Halley</span>’s observation<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>, that by comparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the proportion, which the periodical time of the moon bore
to that of the sun in former times, with the proportion between
them at present, the moon is found to be something
accelerated in respect of the sun. But if the sun diminish,
the periods of the primary planets will be lengthened; and
if the earth be encreased, the period of the moon will be
shortened: as will appear by the next chapter, wherein
it shall be shewn, that the power of the sun and earth is
the result of the same power being lodg’d in all their parts,
and that this principle of producing gravitation in other bodies
is proportional to the solid matter in each body.</p>

power here on the surface of the earth, which we call gravity<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>.
Now one of the effects of the principle of gravity
is, that all bodies descend by this force from the same height
in equal times. Which has been long taken notice of;
particular methods having been invented to shew that the
only cause, why some bodies were observed to fall from the
same height sooner than others, was the resistance of the
air. This we have above related<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>; and proved from hence,
that since bodies resist to any change of their state from rest
to motion, or from motion to rest, in proportion to the
quantity of matter contained in them; the power that can
move different quantities of matter equally, must be proportional
to the quantity. The only objection here is, that
it can hardly be made certain, whether this proportion in
the effect of gravity on different bodies holds perfectly exact
or not from these experiments; by reason that the
great swiftness, with which bodies fall, prevents our being
able to determine the times of their descent with all the
exactness requisite. Therefore to remedy this inconvenience,
our author substitutes another more certain experiment
in the room of these made upon falling bodies. Pendulums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
are caused to vibrate by the same principle, as makes
bodies descend; the power of gravity putting them in motion,
as well as the other.  But if the ball of any pendulum,
of the same length with another, were more or less
attracted in proportion to the quantity of solid matter in
the ball, that pendulum must accordingly move faster or
slower than the other. Now the vibrations of pendulums
continue for a great length of time, and the number of
vibrations they make may easily be determined without
suspicion of error; so that this experiment may be
extended to what exactness one pleases:  and our author
assures us, that he examined in this way several
substances, as gold, silver, lead, glass, sand, common salt,
wood, water, and wheat; in all which he found not the
least deviation from the proportion mentioned, though he
made the experiment in such a manner, that in bodies of
the same weight a difference in the quantity of their matter
less than a thousandth part of the whole would have
discovered it self<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>. It appears therefore, that all bodies are
made to descend by the power of gravity here, near the surface
of the earth, with the same degree of swiftness. We
have above observed this descent to be after the rate of 16⅛
feet in the first second of time from the beginning of their
fall. Moreover it was also observed, that if any body, which
fell here at the surface of the earth after this rate, were
to be conveyed up to the height of the moon, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
descend from thence just with the same degree of velocity,
as that with which the moon is attracted toward the
earth; and therefore the power of the earth upon the moon
bears the same proportion to the power it would have upon
those bodies at the same distance, as the quantity of matter
in the moon bears to the quantity in those bodies.</p>

<p><a name="c250" id="c250">4.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> the assertion laid down is proved in the earth,
that the power of the earth on every body it attracts is, at
the same distance from the earth, proportional to the quantity
of solid matter in the body acted on. As to the sun, it
has been shewn, that the power of the sun’s action upon
the same primary planet is reciprocally in the duplicate proportion
of the distance; and that the power of the sun
decreases throughout in the same proportion, the motion of
comets traversing the whole planetary region testifies. This
proves, that if any planet were removed from the sun to
any other distance whatever, the degree of its acceleration
toward the sun would yet remain reciprocally in the duplicate
proportion of its distance. But it has likewise been
shewn, that the degree of acceleration, which the sun gives
to every one of the planets, is reciprocally in the duplicate
proportion of their respective distances. All which compared
together puts it out of doubt, that the power of
the sun upon any planet, removed into the place of any
ether, would give it the same velocity of descent, as it
gives that other; and consequently, that the sun’s action
upon different planets at the same distance would be proportional
to the quantity of matter in each.  It has farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
been shewn, that the sun attracts the primary planets, and
their respective secondary, when at the same distance, so
as to communicate to both the same degree of velocity;
and therefore the force, wherewith the sun acts on the secondary
planet, bears the same proportion to the force,
wherewith at the same distance it attracts the primary, as
the quantity of solid matter in the secondary planet bears to
the quantity of matter in the primary.</p>

<p><a name="c251" id="c251">5.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> property therefore is proved of both kinds of
planets, in respect of the sun. Therefore the sun possesses the
quality found in the earth, of acting on bodies with a degree
of force proportional to the quantity of matter in the
body, which receives the influence.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap gesperrt">That</span> the power of attraction, with which the other
planets are endued, should differ from that of the earth, can
hardly be supposed, if we consider the similitude between
those bodies; and that it does not in this respect, is farther
proved from the satellites of Saturn and Jupiter, which are attracted
by their respective primary according to the same law,
that is, in the same proportion to their distances, as the primary
are attracted by the sun: so that what has been concluded
of the sun in relation to the primary planets, may be justly
concluded of these primary in respect of their secondary, and
in consequence of that, in regard likewise to all other bodies,
viz. that they will attract every body in proportion to the
quantity of solid matter it contains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Hence</span> it follows, that this attraction extends itself
to every particle of matter in the attracted body: and that
no portion of matter whatever is exempted from the influence
of those bodies, to which we have proved this attractive
power to belong.</p>

<p><a name="c252a" id="c252a">8.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Before</span> we proceed farther, we may here remark,
that this attractive power both of the sun and planets now
appears to be quite of the same nature in all; for it acts in
each in the same proportion to the distance, and in the same
manner acts alike upon every particle of matter. This
power therefore in the sun and other planets is not of a different
nature from this power in the earth; which has been already
shewn to be the same with that, which we call gravity<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c252b" id="c252b">9.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">And</span> this lays open the way to prove, that the attracting
power lodged in the sun and planets, belongs likewise
to every part of them: and that their respective powers
upon the same body are proportional to the quantity of matter,
of which they are composed; for instance, that the force
with which the earth attracts the moon, is to the force, with
which the sun would attract it at the same distance, as the
quantity of solid matter contained in the earth, to the quantity
contained in the sun<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> first of these assertions is a very evident consequence
from the latter. And before we proceed to the proof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
it must first be shewn, that the third law of motion, which
makes action and reaction equal, holds in these attractive
powers. The most remarkable attractive force, next to the
power of gravity, is that, by which the loadstone attracts iron.
Now if a loadstone were laid upon water, and supported by
some proper substance, as wood or cork, so that it might
swim; and if a piece of iron were caused to swim upon the
water in like manner: as soon as the loadstone begins to
attract the iron, the iron shall move toward the stone, and
the stone shall also move toward the iron; when they meet,
they shall stop each other, and remain fixed together without
any motion. This shews, that the velocities, wherewith
they meet, are reciprocally proportional to the quantities
of solid matter in each; and that by the stone’s attracting
the iron, the stone itself receives as much motion,
in the strict philosophic sense of that word<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>, as it communicates
to the iron: for it has been declared above to be an
effect of the percussion of two bodies, that if they meet
with velocities reciprocally proportional to the respective
bodies, they shall be stopped by the concourse, unless their
elasticity put them into fresh motion; but if they meet
with any other velocities, they shall retain some motion
after meeting<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>. Amber, glass, sealing-wax, and many other
substances acquire by rubbing a power, which from its
having been remarkable, particularly in amber, is called
electrical.  By this power they will for some time after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
rubbing attract light bodies, that shall be brought within
the sphere of their activity. On the other hand Mr. <span class="smcap">Boyle</span>
found, that if a piece of amber be hung in a perpendicular
position by a string, it shall be drawn itself toward the body
whereon it was rubbed, if that body be brought near
it. Both in the loadstone and in electrical bodies we usually
ascribe the power to the particular body, whose presence
we find necessary for producing the effect. The loadstone
and any piece of iron will draw each other, but in
two pieces of iron no such effect is ordinarily observed; therefore
we call this attractive power the power of the loadstone:
though near a loadstone two pieces of iron will also
draw each other. In like manner the rubbing of amber,
glass, or any such body, till it is grown warm, being
necessary to cause any action between those bodies and other
substances, we ascribe the electrical power to those bodies.
But in all these cases if we would speak more correctly,
and not extend the sense of our expressions beyond what
we see; we can only say that the neighbourhood of a loadstone
and a piece of iron is attended with a power, whereby
the loadstone and the iron are drawn toward each other;
and the rubbing of electrical bodies gives rise to a power,
whereby those bodies and other substances are mutually attracted.
Thus we must also understand in the power of
gravity, that the two bodies are mutually made to approach
by the action of that power. When the sun draws any
planet, that planet also draws the sun; and the motion,
which the planet receives from the sun, bears the same proportion
to the motion, which the sun it self receives, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the quantity of solid matter in the sun bears to the quantity
of solid matter in the planet. Hitherto, for brevity
sake in speaking of these forces, we have generally ascribed
them to the body, which is least moved; as when we
called the power, which exerts itself between the sun and
any planet, the attractive power of the sun; but to speak
more correctly, we should rather call this power in any
case the force, which acts between the sun and earth, between
the sun and Jupiter, between the earth and moon,
&amp;c. for both the bodies are moved by the power acting between
them, in the same manner, as when two bodies are
tied together by a rope, if that rope shrink by being wet,
or otherwise, and thereby cause the bodies to approach, by
drawing both, it will communicate to both the same degree
of motion, and cause them to approach with velocities
reciprocally proportional to the respective bodies. From
this mutual action between the sun and planet it follows,
as has been observed above<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>, that the sun and planet
do each move about their common center of gravity.
Let A (in fig. 108.) represent the sun, B a planet, C their
common center of gravity. If these bodies were once at
rest, by their mutual attraction they would directly approach
each other with such velocities, that their common
center of gravity would remain at rest, and the two bodies
would at length meet in that point. If the planet B were
to receive an impulse, as in the direction of the line D&nbsp;E,
this would prevent the two bodies from falling together;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
but their common center of gravity would be put into motion
in the direction of the line C&nbsp;F equidistant from B&nbsp;E.
In this case Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> proves<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>, that the sun and
planet would describe round their common center of gravity
similar orbits, while that center would proceed with an
uniform motion in the line C&nbsp;F; and so the system of the
two bodies would move on with the center of gravity without
end. In order to keep the system in the same place,
it is necessary, that when the planet received its impulse in
the direction B&nbsp;E, the sun should also receive such an impulse
the contrary way, as might keep the center of gravity
C without motion; for if these began once to move
without giving any motion to their common center of gravity,
that center would always remain fixed.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> this may be understood in what manner the action
between the sun and planets is mutual. But farther,
we have shewn above<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>, that the power, which acts between
the sun and primary planets, is altogether of the same nature
with that, which acts between the earth and the bodies
at its surface, or between the earth and its parts, and
with that which acts between the primary planets and their
secondary; therefore all these actions must be ascribed to
the same cause<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>. Again, it has been already proved, that
in different planets the force of the sun’s action upon each at
the same distance would be proportional to the quantity of solid
matter in the planet<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>; therefore the reaction of each planet
on the sun at the same distance, or the motion, which the sun
would receive from each planet, would also be proportional
to the quantity of matter in the planet; that is, these planets
at the same distance would act on the same body with
degrees of strength proportional to the quantity of solid matter
in each.</p>

<p><a name="c257" id="c257">12.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the next place, from what has been now proved,
our great author has deduced this farther consequence,
no less surprizing than elegant; that each of the particles,
out of which the bodies of the sun and planets are framed,
exert their power of gravitation by the same law, and in
the same proportion to the distance, as the great bodies
which they compose. For this purpose he first demonstrates,
that if a globe were compounded of particles, which
will attract the particles of any other body reciprocally
in the duplicate proportion of their distances, the whole
globe will attract the same in the reciprocal duplicate proportion
of their distances from the center of the globe;
provided the globe be of uniform density throughout<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>. And
from this our author deduces the reverse, that if a globe acts
upon distant bodies by the law just now specified, and the
power of the globe is derived from its being composed of attractive
particles; each of those particles will attract after the
same proportion<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>. The manner of deducing this is not set
down at large by our author, but is as follows. The globe is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
supposed to act upon the particles of a body without it constantly
in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of their distances
from its center; and therefore at the same distance from
the globe, on which side soever the body be placed, the
globe will act equally upon it. Now because, if the particles,
of which the globe is composed, acted upon those without
in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of their distances,
the whole globe would act upon them in the same manner as
it does; therefore, if the particles of the globe have not all
of them that property, some must act stronger than in that
proportion, while others act weaker: and if this be the condition
of the globe, it is plain, that when the body attracted
is in such a situation in respect of the globe, that the greater
number of the strongest particles are nearest to it, the body
will be more forcibly attracted; than when by turning the
globe about, the greater quantity of weak particles should
be nearest, though the distance of the body should remain
the same from the center of the globe. Which is contrary
to what was at first remarked, that the globe on all sides of
it acts with the same strength at the same distance. Whence it
appears, that no other constitution of the globe can agree to it.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> these propositions it is farther collected, that
if all the particles of one globe attract all the particles of another
in the proportion so often mentioned, the attracting
globe will act upon the other in the same proportion to the
distance between the center of the globe which attracts, and
the center of that which is attracted<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>: and farther, that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
proportion holds true, though either or both the globes be
composed of dissimilar parts, some rarer and some more
dense; provided only, that all the parts in the same globe
equally distant from the center be homogeneous<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>. And
also, if both the globes attract each other<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>. All which place
it beyond contradiction, that this proportion obtains with as
much exactness near and contiguous to the surface of attracting
globes, as at greater distances from them.</p>

<p><a name="c259" id="c259">14.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> our author, without the pompous pretence of
explaining the cause of gravity, has made one very important
step toward it, by shewing that this power in the great bodies
of the universe, is derived from the same power being lodged
in every particle of the matter which composes them: and
consequently, that this property is no less than universal to
all matter whatever, though the power be too minute to produce
any visible effects on the small bodies, wherewith we
converse, by their action on each other<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>. In the fixed stars
indeed we have no particular proof that they have this power;
for we find no apperance to demonstrate that they either
act, or are acted upon by it. But since this power
is found to belong to all bodies, whereon we can make
observation; and we see that it is not to be altered by any
change in the form of bodies, but always accompanies them
in every shape without diminution, remaining ever proportional
to the quantity of solid matter in each; such a
power must without doubt belong universally to all matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> therefore is the universal law of matter; which
recommends it self no less for its great plainness and simplicity,
than for the surprizing discoveries it leads us to. By
this principle we learn the different weight, which the same
body will have upon the surfaces of the sun and of diverse
planets; and by the same we can judge of the composition
of those celestial bodies, and know the density of
each; which is formed of the most compact, and which of
the most rare substance. Let the adversaries of this philosophy
reflect here, whether loading this principle with the
appellation of an occult quality, or perpetual miracle, or
any other reproachful name, be sufficient to dissuade us from
cultivating it; since this quality, which they call occult, leads
to the knowledge of such things, that it would have been reputed
no less than madness for any one, before they had been
discovered, even to have conjectured that our faculties should
ever have reached so far.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap gesperrt">See</span> how all this naturally follows from the foregoing
principles in those planets, which have satellites moving
about them. By the times, in which these satellites
perform their revolutions, compared with their distances
from their respective primary, the proportion between the
power, with which one primary attracts his satellites, and
the force with which any other attracts his will be known;
and the proportion of the power with which any planet
attracts its secondary, to the power with which it attracts a
body at its surface is found, by comparing the distance of
the secondary planet from the center of the primary, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the distance of the primary planet’s surface from the same:
and from hence is deduced the proportion between the power
of gravity upon the surface of one planet, to the gravity upon
the surface of another. By the like method of comparing
the periodical time of a primary planet about the sun, with
the revolution of a satellite about its primary, may be found
the proportion of gravity, or of the weight of any body upon
the surface of the sun, to the gravity, or to the weight of
the same body upon the surface of the planet, which carries
about the satellite.</p>

<p><a name="c261" id="c261">17.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> these kinds of computation it is found, that the
weight of the same body upon the surface of the sun will
be about 23 times as great, as here upon the surface of the
earth; about 10⅗ times as great, as upon the surface of Jupiter;
and near 19 times as great, as upon the surface of Saturn<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.</p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> quantity of matter, which composes each of
these bodies, is proportional to the power it has upon a
body at a given distance. By this means it is found, that the
sun contains 1067 times as much matter as Jupiter; Jupiter
158⅔ times as much as the earth, and 2-5/6 times as much
as Saturn<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. The diameter of the sun is about 92 times,
that of Jupiter about 9 times, and that of Saturn about
7 times the diameter of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> making a comparison between the quantity of
matter in these bodies and their magnitudes, to be found
from their diameters, their respective densities are readily
deduced; the density of every body being measured by the
quantity of matter contained under the same bulk, as has
been above remarked<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>.  Thus the earth is found 4¼ times
more dense than Jupiter; Saturn has between ⅔ and ¾ of the
density of Jupiter; but the sun has one fourth part only of
the density of the earth<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>. From which this observation is drawn
by our author; that the sun is rarified by its great heat, and that
of the three planets named, the more dense is nearer the sun
than the more rare; as was highly reasonable to expect, the
densest bodies requiring the greatest heat to agitate and put
their parts in motion; as on the contrary, the planets which
are more rare, would be rendered unfit for their office, by
the intense heat to which the denser are exposed.  Thus the
waters of our seas, if removed to the distance of Saturn from
the sun, would remain perpetually frozen; and if as near
the sun as Mercury, would constantly boil<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>.</p>

<p>20. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> densities of the three planets Mercury, Venus,
and Mars, which have no satellites, cannot be expresly assigned;
but from what is found in the others, it is very probable,
that they also are of such different degrees of density,
that universally the planet which is nearest to the sun, is
formed of the most compact substance.</p>

Of the FLUID PARTS of the PLANETS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap04">THIS globe, that we inhabit, is composed of two parts;
the solid earth, which affords us a foundation to dwell
upon; and the seas and other waters, that furnish rains and
vapours necessary to render the earth fruitful, and productive
of what is requisite for the support of life. And that the
moon, though but a secondary planet, is composed in like
manner, is generally thought, from the different degrees of
light which appear on its surface; the parts of that planet,
which reflect a dim light, being supposed to be fluid, and to
imbibe the sun’s rays, while the solid parts reflect them more
copiously. Some indeed do not allow this to be a conclusive
argument: but whether we can distinguish the fluid part of
the moon’s surface from the rest or not; yet it is most probable
that there are two such different parts, and with still greater
reason we may ascribe the like to the other primary planets,
which yet more nearly resemble our earth. The earth is also
encompassed by another fluid the air, and we have before remarked,
that probably the rest of the planets are surrounded
by the like. These fluid parts in particular engage our author’s
attention, both by reason of some remarkable appearances
peculiar to them, and likewise of some effects they
have upon the whole bodies to which they belong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="c264" id="c264">2.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Fluids</span> have been already treated of in general, with
respect to the effect they have upon solid bodies moving in
them<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>; now we must consider them in reference to the operation
of the power of gravity upon them. By this power
they are rendered weighty, like all other bodies, in proportion
to the quantity of matter, which is contained in them. And
in any quantity of a fluid the upper parts press upon the lower
as much, as any solid body would press on another, whereon
it should lie. But there is an effect of the pressure of fluids on
the bottom of the vessel, wherein they are contained, which I
shall particularly explain. The force supported by the bottom
of such a vessel is not simply the weight of the quantity
of the fluid in the vessel, but is equal to the weight of that
quantity of the fluid, which would be contained in a vessel of
the same bottom and of equal width throughout, when this
vessel is filled up to the same height, as that to which the vessel
proposed is filled. Suppose water were contained in the
vessel A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D (in fig. 109.) filled up to E&nbsp;F. Here it is evident,
that if a part of the bottom, as G&nbsp;H, which is directly under
any part of the space E&nbsp;F, be considered separately; it will appear
at once, that this part sustains the weight of as much of
the fluid, as stands perpendicularly over it up to the height of
E&nbsp;F; that is, the two perpendiculars G&nbsp;I and H&nbsp;K being drawn,
the part G&nbsp;H of the bottom will sustain the whole weight of
the fluid included between these two perpendiculars. Again,
I say, every other part of the bottom equally broad with this,
will sustain as great a pressure. Let the part L&nbsp;M be of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
same breadth with G&nbsp;H. Here the perpendiculars L&nbsp;O and
M&nbsp;N being drawn, the quantity of water contained between
these perpendiculars is not so great, as that contained between
the perpendiculars G&nbsp;I and H&nbsp;K; yet, I say, the pressure on L&nbsp;M
will be equal to that on G&nbsp;H. This will appear by the following
considerations. It is evident, that if the part of the
vessel between O and N were removed, the water would immediately
flow out, and the surface E&nbsp;F would subside; for
all parts of the water being equally heavy, it must soon form
itself to a level surface, if the form of the vessel, which contains
it, does not prevent. Therefore since the water is prevented
from rising by the side N&nbsp;O of the vessel, it is manifest,
that it must press against N&nbsp;O with some degree of force.
In other words, the water between the perpendiculars L&nbsp;O and
M&nbsp;N endeavours to extend itself with a certain degree of force;
or more correctly, the ambient water presses upon this, and
endeavours to force this pillar or column of water into a greater
length. But since this column of water is sustained between
N&nbsp;O and L&nbsp;M, each of these parts of the vessel will be
equally pressed against by the power, wherewith this column
endeavours to extend. Consequently L&nbsp;M bears this force
over and above the weight of the column of water between
L&nbsp;O and M&nbsp;N. To know what this expansive force is, let the
part O&nbsp;N of the vessel be removed, and the perpendiculars L&nbsp;O
and M&nbsp;N be prolonged; then by means of some pipe fixed
over N&nbsp;O let water be filled between these perpendiculars up to
P&nbsp;Q an equal height with E&nbsp;F. Here the water between the perpendiculars
L&nbsp;P and M&nbsp;Q is of an equal height with the highest
part of the water in the vessel; therefore the water in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
vessel cannot by its pressure force it up higher, nor can the
water in this column subside; because, if it should, it would
raise the water in the vessel to a greater height than itself.
But it follows from hence, that the weight of water contained
between P&nbsp;O and Q&nbsp;N is a just balance to the force, wherewith
the column between L&nbsp;O and M&nbsp;N endeavours to extend. So
the part L&nbsp;M of the bottom, which sustains both this force
and the weight of the water between L&nbsp;O and M&nbsp;N, is pressed
upon by a force equal to the united weight of the water
between L&nbsp;O and M&nbsp;N, and the weight of the water between
P&nbsp;O and Q&nbsp;N; that is, it is pressed on by a force equal to the
weight of all the water contained between L&nbsp;P and M&nbsp;Q. And
this weight is equal to that of the water contained between
G&nbsp;I and H&nbsp;K, which is the weight sustained by the part G&nbsp;H
of the bottom. Now this being true of every part of the
bottom B&nbsp;C, it is evident, that if another vessel R&nbsp;S&nbsp;T&nbsp;V be
formed with a bottom R&nbsp;V equal to the bottom B&nbsp;C, and be
throughout its whole height of one and the same breadth;
when this vessel is filled with water to the same height, as the
vessel A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D is filled, the bottoms of these two vessels shall
be pressed upon with equal force. If the vessel be broader
at the top than at the bottom, it is evident, that the bottom
will bear the pressure of so much of the fluid, as is perpendicularly
over it, and the sides of the vessel will support the
rest. This property of fluids is a corollary from a proposition
of our author<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>; from whence also he deduces the effects
of the pressure of fluids on bodies resting in them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
These are, that any body heavier than a fluid will sink to
the bottom of the vessel, wherein the fluid is contained,
and in the fluid will weigh as much as its own weight exceeds
the weight of an equal quantity of the fluid; any body
uncompressible of the same density with the fluid, will rest
any where in the fluid without suffering the least change either
in its place or figure from the pressure of such a fluid,
but will remain as undisturbed as the parts of the fluid themselves;
but every body of less density than the fluid will
swim on its surface, a part only being received within the
fluid. Which part will be equal in bulk to a quantity of the
fluid, whose weight is equal to the weight of the whole body;
for by this means the parts of the fluid under the body
will suffer as great a pressure as any other parts of the
fluid as much below the surface as these.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the next place, in relation to the air, we have above
made mention, that the air surrounding the earth being
an elastic fluid, the power of gravity will have this effect
on it, to make the lower parts near the surface of the earth
more compact and compressed together by the weight of
the air incumbent, than the higher parts, which are pressed
upon by a less quantity of the air, and therefore sustain
a less weight<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>. It has been also observed, that our author
has laid down a rule for computing the exact degree
of density in the air at all heights from the earth<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>. But
there is a farther effect from the air’s being compressed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the power of gravity, which he has distinctly considered.
The air being elastic and in a state of compression, any tremulous
body will propagate its motion to the air, and excite
therein vibrations, which will spread from the body that
occasions them to a great distance. This is the efficient cause
of sound: for that sensation is produced by the air, which,
as it vibrates, strikes against the organ of hearing. As this
subject was extremely difficult, so our great author’s success
is surprizing.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> author’s doctrine upon this head I shall endeavour
to explain somewhat at large. But preliminary thereto
must be shewn, what he has delivered in general of pressure
propagated through fluids; and also what he has set
down relating to that wave-like motion, which appears upon
the surface of water, when agitated by throwing any thing
into it, or by the reciprocal motion of the finger, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Concerning</span> the first, it is proved, that pressure is
spread through fluids, not only right forward in a streight
line, but also laterally, with almost the same ease and force.
Of which a very obvious exemplification by experiment is
proposed: that is, to agitate the surface of water by the reciprocal
motion of the finger forwards and backwards only;
for though the finger have no circular motion given it, yet the
waves excited in the water will diffuse themselves on each
hand of the direction of the motion, and soon surround the
finger. Nor is what we observe in sounds unlike to this, which
do not proceed in straight lines only, but are heard though a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
mountain intervene, and when they enter a room in any
part of it, they spread themselves into every corner; not by
reflection from the walls, as some have imagined, but as
far as the sense can judge, directly from the place where they
enter.</p>

<p><a name="c269" id="c269">6.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">How</span> the waves are excited in the surface of stagnant
water, may be thus conceived. Suppose in any place, the
water raised above the rest in form of a small hillock; that
water will immediately subside, and raise the circumambient
water above the level of the parts more remote, to which the
motion cannot be communicated under longer time. And
again, the water in subsiding will acquire, like all falling bodies,
a force, which will carry it below the level surface, till
at length the pressure of the ambient water prevailing, it will
rise again, and even with a force like to that wherewith it descended,
which will carry it again above the level.  But in
the mean time the ambient water before raised will subside,
as this did, sinking below the level; and in so doing, will
not only raise the water, which first subsided, but also the water
next without itself.  So that now beside the first hillock,
we shall have a ring investing it, at some distance raised above
the plain surface likewise; and between them the water will
be sunk below the rest of the surface. After this, the first hillock,
and the new made annular rising, will descend; raising
the water between them, which was before depressed, and likewise
the adjacent part of the surface without. Thus will these
annular waves be successively spread more and more. For,
as the hillock subsiding produces one ring, and that ring subsiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
raises again the hillock, and a second ring; so the hillock
and second ring subsiding together raise the first ring,
and a third; then this first and third ring subsiding together
raise the first hillock, the second ring, and a fourth; and so
on continually, till the motion by degrees ceases. Now it is demonstrated,
that these rings ascend and descend in the manner
of a pendulum; descending with a motion continually accelerated,
till they become even with the plain surface of the fluid,
which is half the space they descend; and then being retarded
again by the same degrees as those, whereby they were
accelerated, till they are depressed below the plain surface, as
much as they were before raised above it: and that this augmentation
and diminution of their velocity proceeds by the same
degrees, as that of a pendulum vibrating in a cycloid, and
whose length should be a fourth part of the distance between
any two adjacent waves: and farther, that a new ring is
produced every time a pendulum, whose length is four times
the former, that is, equal to the interval between the summits
of two waves, makes one oscillation or swing<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c270" id="c270">7.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> now opens the way for understanding the motion
consequent upon the tremors of the air, excited by
the vibrations of sonorous bodies: which we must conceive
to be performed in the following manner.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Let</span> A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H (in fig. 110.) represent a series
of the particles of the air, at equal distances from each
other. I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L a musical chord, which I shall use for the tremulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and sonorous body, to make the conception as simple
as may be. Suppose this chord stretched upon the points
I and L, and forcibly drawn into the situation I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L, so that
it become contiguous to the particle A in its middle point K:
and let the chord from this situation begin to recoil, pressing
against the particle A, which will thereby be put into motion
towards B: but the particles A, B, C being equidistant, the
elastic power, by which B avoids A, is equal to, and balanced
by the power, by which it avoids C; therefore the elastic
force, by which B is repelled from A, will not put B into any
degree of motion, till A is by the motion of the chord brought
nearer to B, than B is to C: but as soon as that is done, the
particle B will be moved towards C; and being made to approach
C, will in the next place move that; which will upon
that advance, put D likewise into motion, and so on:
therefore the particle A being moved by the chord, the following
particles of the air B, C, D, &amp;c. will successively be
moved. Farther, if the point K of the chord moves forward
with an accelerated velocity, so that the particle A shall
move against B with an advancing pace, and gain ground of
it, approaching nearer and nearer continually; A by approaching
will press more upon B, and give it a greater velocity
likewise, by reason that as the distance between the particles
diminishes, the elastic power, by which they fly each other,
increases. Hence the particle B, as well as A, will have its
motion gradually accelerated, and by that means will more
and more approach to C. And from the same cause C will
more and more approach D; and so of the rest. Suppose
now, since the agitation of these particles has been shewn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
be successive, and to follow one another, that E be the remotest
particle moved, while the chord is moving from its
curve situation I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L into that of a streight line, as I&nbsp;k&nbsp;L; and
F the first which remains unaffected, though just upon the
point of being put into motion. Then shall the particles
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, when the point K is moved into k, have
acquired the rangement represented by the adjacent points
<i>a, b, c, d, e, f, g</i>: in which <i>a</i> is nearer to <i>b</i> than <i>b</i> to <i>c</i>, and
<i>b</i> nearer to <i>c</i> than <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>, and <i>c</i> nearer to <i>d</i> than <i>d</i> to <i>e</i> and
<i>d</i> nearer to <i>e</i> than <i>e</i> to <i>f</i>, and lastly <i>e</i> nearer to <i>f</i> than <i>f</i> to <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> now the chord having recovered its rectilinear situation
I&nbsp;k&nbsp;L, the following motion will be changed, for the
point K, which before advanced with a motion more and
more accelerated, though by the force it has acquired it will
go on to move the same way as before, till it has advanced
near as far forwards, as it was at first drawn backwards; yet
the motion of it will henceforth be gradually lessened. The
effect of which upon the particles <i>a, b, c, d, e, f, g</i> will be,
that by the time the chord has made its utmost advance, and
is upon the return, these particles will be put into a contrary
rangement; so that <i>f</i> shall be nearer to <i>g</i>, than <i>e</i> to <i>f</i>, and
<i>e</i> nearer to <i>f</i> than <i>d</i> to <i>e</i>; and the like of the rest, till you
come to the first particles <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, whose distance will then be
nearly or quite what it was at first. All which will appear
as follows. The present distance between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is such,
that the elastic power, by which <i>a</i> repels <i>b</i>, is strong enough to
maintain that distance, though a advance with the velocity,
with which the string resumes its rectilinear figure; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
motion of the particle <i>a</i> being afterwards slower, the
present elasticity between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> will be more than
sufficient to preserve the distance between them. Therefore
while it accelerates <i>b</i> it will retard <i>a</i>. The distance
<i>b&nbsp;c</i> will still diminish, till <i>b</i> come about as near
to <i>c</i>, as it is from a at present; for after the distances
<i>a&nbsp;b</i> and <i>b&nbsp;c</i> are become equal, the particle <i>b</i> will continue
its velocity superior to that of <i>c</i> by its own power of inactivity,
till such time as the increase of elasticity between
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i> more than shall be between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> shall suppress
its motion: for as the power of inactivity in <i>b</i> made a
greater elasticity necessary on the side of a than on the side
of <i>c</i> to push <i>b</i> forward, so what motion <i>b</i> has acquired it will
retain by the same power of inactivity, till it be suppressed
by a greater elasticity on the side of <i>c</i>, than on the side of <i>a</i>.
But as soon as <i>b</i> begins to slacken its pace the distance of <i>b</i>
from c will widen as the distance <i>a&nbsp;b</i> has already done. Now
as <i>a</i> acts on <i>b</i>, so will <i>b</i> on <i>c</i>, <i>c</i> on <i>d</i>, &amp;c. so that the distances
between all the particles <i>b, c, d, e, f, g</i> will be successively
contracted into the distance of <i>a</i> from <i>b</i>, and then dilated
again. Now because the time, in which the chord describes
this present half of its vibration, is about equal to that it took
up in describing the former; the particles <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> will be as long
in dilating their distance, as before in contracting it, and
will return nearly to their original distance. And farther,
the particles <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, which did not begin to approach so soon
as <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, are now about as much longer, before they begin to
recede; and likewise the particles <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, which began to approach
after <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, begin to separate later. Whence it appears
that the particles, whose distance began to be lessened, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
that of <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> was first enlarged, viz. the particles <i>f</i>, <i>g,</i> should
be about their nearest distance, when <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> have recovered
their prime interval. Thus will the particles <i>a, b, c, d,
e, f, g</i> have changed their situation in the manner asserted.
But farther, as the particles <i>f</i>, <i>g</i> or F, G gradually approach
each other, they will move by degrees the succeeding particles
to as great a length, as the particles A, B did by a like
approach. So that, when the chord has made its greatest advance,
being arrived into the situation I ϰ L, the particles moved
by it will have the rangement noted by the points α, β, γ,
δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, λ, μ, ν, χ. Where α, β are at the original distance of
the particles in the line A&nbsp;H; ζ, η are the nearest of all, and
the distance ν&nbsp;χ is equal to that between α and β.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">By</span> this time the chord I&nbsp;ϰ&nbsp;L begins to return, and the
distance between the particles α and β being enlarged to its
original magnitude, α has lost all that force it had acquired
by its motion, being now at rest; and therefore will
return with the chord, making the distance between α and
β greater than the natural; for β will not return so soon,
because its motion forward is not yet quite suppressed, the
distance β&nbsp;γ not being already enlarged to its prime dimension:
but the recess of α, by diminishing the pressure upon
β by its elasticity, will occasion the motion of β to be
stopt in a little time by the action of γ, and then shall
β begin to return: at which time the distance between γ
and δ shall by the superior action of δ above β be enlarged
to the dimension of the distance β&nbsp;γ, and therefore
soon after to that of α&nbsp;β. Thus it appears, that each of
these particles goes on to move forward, till its distance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the preceding one be equal to its original distance; the
whole chain α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, having an undulating motion
forward, which is stopt gradually by the excess of the expansive
power of the preceding parts above that of the
hinder. Thus are these parts successively stopt, as before
they were moved; so that when the chord has regained its
rectilinear situation, the expansion of the parts of the air
will have advanced so far, that the interval between ζ&nbsp;η,
which at present is most contracted, will then be restored
to its natural size: the distances between η and θ, θ and λ, λ
and μ, μ and ν, ν and χ, being successively contracted into
the present distance of ζ from η, and again enlarged; so
that the same effect shall be produced upon the parts beyond
ζ&nbsp;η, by the enlargement of the distance between those two
particles, as was occasioned upon the particles α, β, γ, δ, ε,
ζ, η, θ, λ, μ, ν, χ, by the enlargement of the distance α&nbsp;β to
its natural extent. And therefore the motion in the air
will be extended half as much farther as at present, and
the distance between ν and χ contracted into that, which
is at present between ζ and η, all the particles of the air
in motion taking the rangement expressed in figure
111. by the points α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, λ, μ, ν, χ, ϰ, ρ, σ,  τ, φ
wherein the particles from α to χ have their distances from
each other gradually diminished, the distances between the
particles ν, χ being contracted the most from the natural distance
between those particles, and the distance between α, β as
much augmented, and the distance between the middle particles
ζ, η becoming equal to the natural. The particles π, ρ, ω<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>τ, φ which follow χ, have their distances gradually greater
and greater, the particles ν, χ, π, ρ, σ, τ, φ being ranged like
the particles <i>a, b, c, d, e, f, g</i>, or like the particles ζ, η, θ, λ,
μ, ν, χ in the former figure. Here it will be understood, by what
has been before explained, that the particles ζ, η being at
their natural distance from each other, the particle ζ is at
rest, the particles ε, δ, λ, β, ϰ between them and the string
being in motion backward, and the rest of the particles
η, θ, λ, μ, ν, χ, π, ρ, σ, τ in motion forward: each of the particles
between η and χ moving faster than that, which immediately
follows it; but of the particles from χ to φ, on
the contrary, those behind moving on faster than those,
which precede.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> now the string having recovered its rectilinear
figure, though it shall go on recoiling, till it return near to its
first situation I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L, yet there will be a change in its motion; so
that whereas it returned from the situation I&nbsp;ϰ&nbsp;L with an accelerated
motion, its motion shall from hence be retarded
again by the same degrees, as accelerated before. The effect
of which change upon the particles of the air will be
this. As by the accelerated motion of the chord α contiguous
to it moved faster than β, γ, so as to make the interval
α&nbsp;β greater than the interval β&nbsp;γ, and from thence β
was made likewise to move faster than γ, and the distance between
β and γ rendered greater than the distance between γ
and δ, and so of the rest; now the motion of α being diminished,
β shall overtake it, and the distance between α
and β be reduced into that, which is at present between β and
γ, the interval between β and γ being inlarged into the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
distance between α and β; but when the interval β&nbsp;γ
is increased to that, which is at present between α and β&nbsp;γ
the distance between γ and δ shall be enlarged to the present
distance between γ and β, and the distance between δ
and ι inlarged into the present distance between γ and δ;
and the same of the rest. But the chord more and more
slackening its pace, the distance between α and β shall be
more and more diminished; and in consequence of that the
distance between β and γ shall be again contracted, first into
its present dimension, and afterwards into a narrower
space; while the interval γ&nbsp;δ shall dilate into that at present
between α and β, and as soon as it is so much enlarged, it shall
contract again. Thus by the reciprocal expansion and contraction
of the air between α and ζ, by that time the chord
is got into the situation I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L, the interval ζ&nbsp;η shall be expanded
into the present distance between α and β; and by
that time likewise the present distance of α from β will be
contracted into their natural interval: for this distance will
be about the same time in contracting it self, as has been
taken up in its dilatation; seeing the string will be as long
in returning from its rectilinear figure, as it has been in recovering
it from its situation I&nbsp;ϰ&nbsp;L. This is the change
which will be made in the particles between α and ζ. As
for those between ζ and χ, because each preceding particle
advances faster than that, which immediately follows it,
their distances will successively be dilated into that, which
is at present between ζ and η. And as soon as any two
particles are arrived at their natural distance, the hindermost
of them shall be stopt, and immediately after return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the distances between the returning particles being greater
than the natural. And this dilatation of these distances shall
extend so far, by that time the chord is returned into its first
situation I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L, that the particles ι&nbsp;χ shall be removed to their
natural distance. But the dilatation of ν&nbsp;χ shall contract
the interval τ&nbsp;φ into that at present between ν and χ, and the
contraction of the distance between those two particles τ
and φ will agitate a part of the air beyond; so that when
the chord is returned into the situation I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L, having made
an intire vibration, the moved particles of the air will take
the rangement expressed by the points, <i>l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s,
t, u, w, x, y, z</i>, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8: in which <i>l&nbsp;m</i>, are at
the natural distance of the particles, the distance <i>m&nbsp;n</i> greater
than <i>l&nbsp;m</i> and <i>n&nbsp;o</i> greater than <i>m&nbsp;n</i>, and so on, till you come
to <i>q&nbsp;r</i>, the widest of all: and then the distances gradually
diminish not only to the natural distance, as <i>w&nbsp;x</i>, but till
they are contracted as much as χ&nbsp;τ was before; which falls
out in the points 2, 3, from whence the distances augment
again, till you come to the part of the air untouched.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> is the motion, into which the air is put, while
the chord makes one vibration, and the whole length of air
thus agitated in the time of one vibration of the chord our
author calls the length of one pulse. When the chord goes
on to make another vibration, it will not only continue to
agitate the air at present in motion, but spread the pulsation
of the air as much farther, and by the same degrees, as before.
For when the chord returns into its rectilinear situation
I&nbsp;<i>k</i>&nbsp;L, <i>l&nbsp;m</i> shall be brought into its most contracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
state, <i>q&nbsp;r</i> now in the state of greatest dilatation shall be reduced
to its natural distance, the points <i>w</i>, <i>x</i> now at their
natural distance shall be at their greatest distance, the points
2, 3 now most contracted enlarged to their natural distance,
and the points 7, 8 reduced to their most contracted state:
and the contraction of them will carry the agitation of the
air as far beyond them, as that motion was carried from the
chord, when it first moved out of the situation I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L into
its rectilinear figure. When the chord is got into the situation
I&nbsp;ϰ&nbsp;L, <i>l&nbsp;m</i> shall recover its natural dimensions, <i>q&nbsp;r</i> be
reduced to its state of greatest contraction, <i>w&nbsp;x</i> brought to
its natural dimension, the distance 2&nbsp;3 enlarged to the utmost,
and the points 7, 8 shall have recovered their natural
distance; and by thus recovering themselves they shall
agitate the air to as great a length beyond them, as it was
moved beyond the chord, when it first came into the situation
I&nbsp;ϰ&nbsp;L. When the chord is returned back again into
its rectilinear situation, <i>l&nbsp;m</i> shall be in its utmost dilatation,
<i>q&nbsp;r</i> restored again to its natural distance, <i>w&nbsp;x</i> reduced into
its state of greatest contraction, 2&nbsp;3 shall recover its natural
dimension, and 7&nbsp;8 be in its state of greatest dilatation.
By which means the air shall be moved as far beyond the points
7, 8, as it was moved beyond the chord, when it before made
its return back to its rectilinear situation; for the particles
7, 8 have been changed from their state of rest and their
natural distance into a state of contraction, and then have
proceeded to the recovery of their natural distance, and after
that to a dilatation of it, in the same manner as the
particles contiguous to the chord were agitated before. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the last place, when the chord is returned into the situation
I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L, the particles of air from <i>l</i> to δ shall acquire their present
rangement, and the motion of the air be extended as
much farther. And the like will happen after every compleat
vibration of the string.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Concerning</span> this motion of sound, our author
shews how to compute the velocity thereof, or in what time
it will reach to any proposed distance from the sonorous
body. For this he requires to know the height of air, having
the same density with the parts here at the surface of
the earth, which we breath, that would be equivalent in
weight to the whole incumbent atmosphere. This is to
be found by the barometer, or common weatherglass. In
that instrument quicksilver is included in a hollow glass
cane firmly closed at the top. The bottom is open, but
immerged into quicksilver contained in a vessel open to the
air. Care is taken when the lower end of the cane is immerged,
that the whole cane be full of quicksilver, and that no air
insinuate itself. When the instrument is thus fixed, the quicksilver
in the cane being higher than that in the vessel, if
the top of the cane were open, the fluid would soon sink
out of the glass cane, till it came to a level with that in
the vessel. But the top of the cane being closed up, so
that the air, which has free liberty to press on the quicksilver
in the vessel, cannot bear at all on that, which is within
the cane, the quicksilver in the cane will be suspended
to such a height, as to balance the pressure of the air on
the quicksilver in the vessel. Here it is evident, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
weight of the quicksilver in the glass cane is equivalent to
the pressure of so much of the air, as is perpendicularly over
the hollow of the cane; for if the cane be opened that the
air may enter, there will be no farther use of the quicksilver
to sustain the pressure of the air without; for the quicksilver
in the cane, as has already been observed, will then subside
to a level with that without. Hence therefore if the proportion
between the density of quicksilver and of the air we
breath be known, we may know what height of such air would
form a column equal in weight to the column of quicksilver
within the glass cane. When the quicksilver is sustained
in the barometer at the height of 30 inches, the height
of such a column of air will be about 29725 feet; for in
this case the air has about 1/870 of the density of water, and
the density of quicksilver exceeds that of water about
13⅔ times, so that the density of quicksilver exceeds that
of the air about 11890 times; and so many times 30 inches
make 29725 feet. Now Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> determines,
that while a pendulum of the length of this column
should make one vibration or swing, the space, which any
sound will have moved, shall bear to this length the same
proportion, as the circumference of a circle bears to the diameter
thereof; that is, about the proportion of 355 to
113<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>. Only our author here considers singly the gradual
progress of sound in the air from particle to particle in the
manner we have explained, without taking into consideration
the magnitude of those particles. And though there
requires time for the motion to be propagated from one particle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to another, yet it is communicated to the whole of
the same particle in an instant: therefore whatever proportion
the thickness of these particles bears to their distance
from each other, in the same proportion will the motion
of sound be swifter. Again the air we breath is not simply
composed of the elastic part, by which sound is conveyed,
but partly of vapours, which are of a different nature;
and in the computation of the motion of sound we
ought to find the height of a column of this pure air only,
whose weight should be equal to the weight of the quicksilver
in the cane of the barometer, and this pure air being a
part only of that we breath, the column of this pure air will
be higher than 29725 feet. On both these accounts the
motion of sound is found to be about 1142 feet in one second
of time, or near 13 miles in a minute, whereas by the
computation proposed above, it should move but 979 feet
in one second.</p>

<p><a name="c282" id="c282">14.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">We</span> may observe here, that from these demonstrations
of our author it follows, that all sounds whether acute
or grave move equally swift, and that sound is swiftest,
when the quicksilver stands highest in the barometer.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> much of the appearances, which are caused in
these fluids from their gravitation toward the earth. They
also gravitate toward the moon; for in the last chapter it
has been proved, that the gravitation between the earth and
moon is mutual, and that this gravitation of the whole bodies
arises from that power acting in all their parts; so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
every particle of the moon gravitates toward the earth,
and every particle of the earth toward the moon. But
this gravitation of these fluids toward the moon produces
no sensible effect, except only in the sea, where it causes
the tides.</p>

<p><a name="c283" id="c283">16.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">That</span> the tides depend upon the influence of the
moon has been the receiv’d opinion of all antiquity; nor is
there indeed the least shadow of reason to suppose otherwise,
considering how steadily they accompany the moon’s course.
Though how the moon caused them, and by what principle
it was enabled to produce so distinguish’d an appearance,
was a secret left for this philosophy to unfold: which teaches,
that the moon is not here alone concerned, but that the
sun likewise has a considerable share in their production;
though they have been generally ascribed to the other luminary,
because its effect is greatest, and by that means
the tides more immediately suit themselves to its motion;
the sun discovering its influence more by enlarging or restraining
the moon’s power, than by any distinct effects.
Our author finds the power of the moon to bear to the
power of the sun about the proportion of 4½ to 1. This
he deduces from the observations made at the mouth of
the river Avon, three miles from Bristol, by Captain <span class="smcap">Sturmey</span>,
and at Plymouth by Mr. <span class="smcap">Colepresse</span>, of the height
to which the water is raised in the conjunction and opposition
of the luminaries, compared with the elevation of it,
when the moon is in either quarter; the first being caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
by the united actions of the sun and moon, and the other
by the difference of them, as shall hereafter be shewn.</p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap gesperrt">That</span> the sun should have a like effect on the sea,
as the moon, is very manifest; since the sun likewise attracts
every single particle, of which this earth is composed. And
in both luminaries since the power of gravity is reciprocally
in the duplicate proportion of the distance, they will not
draw all the parts of the waters in the same manner; but
must act upon the nearest parts stronger, than upon the remotest,
producing by this inequality an irregular motion.
We shall now attempt to shew how the actions of the sun
and moon on the waters, by being combined together, produce
all the appearances observed in the tides.</p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap gesperrt">To</span> begin therefore, the reader will remember what
has been said above, that if the moon without the sun would
have described an orbit concentrical to the earth, the action
of the sun would make the orbit oval, and bring the moon
nearer to the earth at the new and full, than at the quarters<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>.
Now our excellent author observes, that if instead of one moon,
we suppose a ring of moons, contiguous and occupying the
whole orbit of the moon, his demonstration would still take
place, and prove that the parts of this ring in passing from the
quarter to the conjunction or opposition would be accelerated,
and be retarded again in passing from the conjunction or opposition
to the next quarter. And as this effect does not depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
on the magnitude of the bodies, whereof the ring is
composed, the same would hold, though the magnitude of
these moons were so far to be diminished, and their number
increased, till they should form a fluid<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>. Now the
earth turns round continually upon its own center, causing
thereby the alternate change of day and night, while
by this revolution each part of the earth is successively
brought toward the sun, and carried off again in the space
of 24 hours. And as the sea revolves round along with the
earth itself in this diurnal motion, it will represent in some
sort such a fluid ring.</p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> as the water of the sea does not move round
with so much swiftness, as would carry it about the center
of the earth in the circle it now describes, without being
supported by the body of the earth; it will be necessary to
consider the water under three distinct cases. The first case
shall suppose the water to move with the degree of swiftness,
required to carry a body round the center of the earth disingaged
from it in a circle at the distance of the earth’s
semidiameter, like another moon. The second case is, that
the waters make but one turn about the axis of the earth
in the space of a month, keeping pace with the moon;
so that all parts of the water should preserve continually
the same situation in respect of the moon. The third
case shall be the real one of the waters moving with a velocity
between these two, neither so swift as the first case
requires, nor so slow as the second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>20. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the first case the waters, like the body which
they equalled in velocity, by the action of the moon would
be brought nearer the center under and opposite to the moon,
than in the parts in the middle between these eastward or
westward. That such a body would so alter its distance by
the moon’s action upon it, is clear from what has been
mentioned of the like changes in the moon’s motion caused
by the sun<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>. And computation shews, that the difference
between the greatest and least distance of such a body
would not be much above 4½ feet. But in the second
case, where all the parts of the water preserve the same situation
continually in respect of the moon, the weight of those
parts under and opposite to the moon will be diminished
by the moon’s action, and the parts in the middle between
these will have their weight increased: this being effected
just in the same manner, as the sun diminishes the attraction
of the moon towards the earth in the conjunction and
opposition, but increases that attraction in the quarters.
For as the first of these consequences from the sun’s action
on the moon is occasioned by the moon’s being attracted
by the sun in the conjunction more than the earth,
and in the opposition less than it, and therefore in the
common motion of the earth and moon, the moon is
made to advance toward the sun in one case too fast, and
in the other is left as it were behind; so the earth will
not have its middle parts drawn towards the moon so strongly
as the nearer parts, and yet more forcibly than the remotest:
and therefore since the earth and moon move each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
month round their common center of gravity<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>, while
the earth moves round this center, the same effect will be
produced, on the parts of the water nearest to that center
or to the moon, as the moon feels from the sun when
in conjunction, and the water on the contrary side of the
earth will be affected by the moon, as the moon is by the
sun, when in opposition<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>; that is, in both cases the weight
of the water, or its propensity towards the center of the
earth, will be diminished. The parts in the middle between
these will have their weight increased, by being pressed
towards the center of the earth through the obliquity of
the moon’s action upon them to its action upon the earth’s
center, just as the sun increases the gravitation of the moon
in the quarters from the same cause<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>. But now it is manifest,
that where the weight of the same quantity of water
is least, there it will be accumulated; while the parts, which
have the greatest weight, will subside. Therefore in this
case there would be no tide or alternate rising and falling
of the water, but the water would form it self into an
oblong figure, whose axis prolonged would pass through
the moon. By Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em>’s computation the
excess of this axis above the diameters perpendicular to it,
that is, the height of the waters under and opposite to the
moon above their height in the middle between these places
eastward or westward caused by the moon, is about
8⅔ feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>21. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> the difference of height in this latter supposition
is little short of twice that difference in the preceding.
But the case of the sea is a middle between these
two: for a body, which should revolve round the center
of the earth at the distance of a semidiameter without pressing
on the earth’s surface, must perform its period in less than
an hour and half, whereas the earth turns round but once
in a day; and in the case of the waters keeping pace with
the moon it should turn round but once in a month: so
that the real motion of the water is between the motions required
in these two cases. Again, if the waters moved round
as swiftly as the first case required, their weight would be
wholly taken off by their motion; for this case supposes
the body to move so, as to be kept revolving in a circle
round the earth by the power of gravity without pressing
on the earth at all, so that its motion just supports its weight.
But if the power of gravity had been only 1/289 part of
what it is, the body could have moved thus without pressing
on the earth, and have been as long in moving round,
as the earth it self is. Consequently the motion of the
earth takes off from the weight of the water in the middle
between the poles, where its motion is swiftest, 1/289 part
of its weight and no more.  Since therefore in the first
case the weight of the waters must be intirely taken off by
their motion, and by the real motion of the earth they lose
only 1/289 part thereof, the motion of the water will so little
diminish their weight, that their figure will much nearer resemble
the case of their keeping pace with the moon than the
other. Upon the whole, if the waters moved with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
velocity necessary to carry a body round the center of the
earth at the distance of the earth’s semidiameter without
bearing on its surface, the water would be lowest under
the moon, and rise gradually as it moved on with the earth
eastward, till it came half way toward the place opposite
to the moon; from thence it would subside again, till it
came to the opposition, where it would become as low as
at first; afterwards it would rise again, till it came half
way to the place under the moon; and from hence it
would subside, till it came a second time under the moon.
But in case the water kept pace with the moon, it
would be highest where in the other case it is lowest,
and lowest where in the other it is highest; therefore the
diurnal motion of the earth being between the motions of
these two cases, it will cause the highest place of the water to
fall between the places of the greatest height in these two
cases. The water as it passes from under the moon shall
for some time rise, but descend again before it arrives half
way to the opposite place, and shall come to its least
height before it becomes opposite to the moon; then it shall
rise again, continuing so to do till it has passed the place
opposite to the moon, but subside before it comes to the
middle between the places opposite to and under the moon;
and lastly it shall come to its lowest, before it comes a second
time under the moon. If A (in fig. 112, 113, 114.)
represent the moon, B the center of the earth, the oval C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F
in fig. 112. will represent the situation of the water in the
first case; but if the water kept pace with the moon,
the line C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F in fig. 113. would represent the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of the water; but the line C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F in fig. 114. will represent
the same in the real motion of the water, as it
accompanies the earth in its diurnal rotation: in all these
figures C and E being the places where the water is lowest,
and D and F the places where it is highest. Pursuant
to this determination it is found, that on the shores,
which lie exposed to the open sea, the high water usually
falls out about three hours after the moon has passed the
meridian of each place.</p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Let</span> this suffice in general for explaining the manner,
in which the moon acts upon the seas. It is farther
to be noted, that these effects are greatest, when the moon
is over the earth’s equator<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>, that is, when it shines perpendicularly
upon the parts of the earth in the middle between
the poles. For if the moon were placed over either of the
poles, it could have no effect upon the water to make it ascend
and descend. So that when the moon declines from the equator
toward either pole, it’s action must be something
diminished, and that the more, the farther it declines. The
tides likewise will be greatest, when the moon is
nearest to the earth, it’s action being then the strongest.</p>

<p>23. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> much of the action of the moon. That
the sun should produce the very same effects, though in
a less degree, is too obvious to require a particular explanation:
but as was remarked before, this action of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
sun being weaker than that of the moon, will cause the
tides to follow more nearly the moon’s course, and principally
shew it self by heightening or diminishing the effects
of the other luminary. Which is the occasion, that
the highest tides are found about the conjunction and opposition
of the luminaries, being then produced by their united
action, and the weakest tides about the quarters of
the moon; because the moon in this case raising the water
where the sun depresses it, and depressing it where the
sun raises it, the stronger action of the moon is in part
retunded and weakened by that of the sun. Our author
computes that the sun will add near two feet to the height
of the water in the first case, and in the other take from
it as much. However the tides in both comply with the
same hour of the moon.  But at other times, between
the conjunction or opposition and quarters, the time deviates
from that forementioned, towards the hour in which
the sun would make high water, though still it keeps much
nearer to the moon’s hour than to the sun’s.</p>

<p>24. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Again</span> the tides have some farther varieties from
the situation of the places where they happen northward
or southward. Let <i>p</i>&nbsp;P (in fig. 115.) represent the axis, on
which the earth daily revolves, let <i>h</i>&nbsp;<i>p</i>&nbsp;H&nbsp;P represent the
figure of the water, and let <i>n</i>&nbsp;B&nbsp;N&nbsp;D be a globe inscribed
within this figure. Suppose the moon to be advanced
from the equator toward the north pole, so that <i>h</i>&nbsp;H the
axis of the figure of the water <i>p</i>&nbsp;A&nbsp;H&nbsp;P&nbsp;E&nbsp;<i>h</i> shall decline
towards the north pole N; take any place G nearer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the north pole than to the south, and from the center
of the earth C draw C&nbsp;G&nbsp;F; then will G&nbsp;F denote the altitude
to which the water is raised by the tide, when the moon is
above the horizon: in the space of twelve hours, the earth
having turned half round its axis, the place G will be removed
to <i>g</i>; but the axis <i>h</i>&nbsp;H will have kept its place preserving its
situation in respect of the moon, at least will have moved no
more than the moon has done in that time, which it is not
necessary here to take into consideration. Now in this case
the height of the water will be equal to <i>g</i>&nbsp;<i>f</i>, which is
not so great as G&nbsp;F. But whereas G&nbsp;F is the altitude at
high water, when the moon is above the horizon, <i>g</i>&nbsp;<i>f</i> will
be the altitude of the same, when the moon is under the
horizon. The contrary happens toward the south pole, for
K&nbsp;L is less than <i>k</i>&nbsp;<i>l</i>. Hence is proved, that when the moon
declines from the equator, in those places, which are on
the same side of the equator as the moon, the tides are
greater, when the moon is above the horizon, than when
under it; and the contrary happens on the other side of
the equator.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> from these principles may be explained all
the known appearances in the tides; only by the assistance
of this additional remark, that the fluctuating motion,
which the water has in flowing and ebbing, is of a
durable nature, and would continue for some time, though
the action of the luminaries should cease; for this prevents
the difference between the tide when the moon is above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the horizon, and the tide when the moon is below it from
being so great, as the rule laid down requires. This likewise
makes the greatest tides not exactly upon the new and full
moon, but to be a tide or two after; as at Bristol and Plymouth
they are found the third after.</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> doctrine farther shews us, why not only the
spring tides fall out about the new and full moon, and the
neap tides about the quarters; but likewise how it comes
to pass, that the greatest spring tides happen about the equinoxes;
because the luminaries are then one of them over the
equator, and the other not far from it. It appears too, why
the neap tides, which accompany these, are the least of all,
for the sun still continuing over the equator continues to have
the greatest power of lessening the moon’s action, and the
moon in the quarters being far removed toward one of the
poles, has its power thereby weakned.</p>

<p>27. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Moreover</span> the action of the moon being stronger,
when near the earth, than when more remote; if the moon,
when new suppose, be at its nearest distance from the earth,
it shall when at the full be farthest off; whence it is, that
two of the very largest spring tides do never immediately
succeed each other.</p>

<p>28. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Because</span> the sun in its passage from the winter
solstice to the summer recedes from the earth, and passing
from the summer solstice to the winter approaches it, and
is therefore nearer the earth before the vernal equinox than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
after, but nearer after the autumnal equinox than before;
the greatest tides oftner precede the vernal equinox than
follow it, and in the autumnal equinox on the contrary
they oftner follow it than come before it.</p>

<p>29. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> altitude, to which the water is raised in the
open ocean, corresponds very well to the forementioned calculations;
for as it was shewn, that the water in spring tides
should rise to the height of 10 or 11 feet, and the neap
tides to 6 or 7; accordingly in the Pacific, Atlantic and
Ethiopic oceans in the parts without the tropics, the
water is observed to rise about 6, 9, 12 or 15 feet.  In the
Pacific ocean this elevation is said to be greater than in the
other, as it ought to be by reason of the wide extent of
that sea. For the same reason in the Ethiopic ocean between
the tropics the ascent of the water is less than without,
by reason of the narrowness of the sea between the
coasts of Africa and the southern parts of America.
And islands in such narrow seas, if far from shore, have
less tides than the coasts. But now in those ports where
the water flows in with great violence upon fords and shoals,
the force it acquires by that means will carry it to a much
greater height, so as to make it ascend and descend to 30,
40 or even 50 feet and more; instances of which we have
at Plymouth, and in the Severn near Chepstow; at
St. Michael’s and Auranches in Normandy; at Cambay and
Pegu in the East Indies.</p>

<p>30. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Again</span> the tides take a considerable time in passing
through long straits, and shallow places. Thus the tide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
which is made on the west coast of Ireland and on the
coast of Spain at the third hour after the moon’s coming
to the meridian, in the ports eastward toward the British
channel falls out later, and as the flood passes up that channel
still later and later, so that the tide takes up full twelve
hours in coming up to London bridge.</p>

<p>31. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the last place tides may come to the same port
from different seas, and as they may interfere with each
other, they will produce particular effects.  Suppose the
tide from one sea come to a port at the third hour after
the moon’s passing the meridian of the place, but from
another sea to take up six hours more in its passage.  Here
one tide will make high water, when by the other it should
be lowest; so that when the moon is over the equator, and
the two tides are equal, there will be no rising and falling
of the water at all; for as much as the water is carried off
by one tide, it will be supplied by the other. But when the
moon declines from the equator, the same way as the port
is situated, we have shewn that of the two tides of the
ocean, which are made each day, that tide, which is made
when the moon is above the horizon, is greater than the
other. Therefore in this case, as four tides come to this
port each day the two greatest will come on the third, and
on the ninth hour after the moon’s passing the meridian,
and the two least at the fifteenth and at the twenty first
hour. Thus from the third to the ninth hour more water
will be in this port by the two greatest tides than from
the ninth to the fifteenth, or from the twenty first to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
following third hour, where the water is brought by one
great and one small tide; but yet there will be more
water brought by these tides, than what will be found between
the two least tides, that is, between the fifteenth and
twenty first hour. Therefore in the middle between the
third and ninth hour, or about the moon’s setting, the water
will be at its greatest height; in the middle between the
ninth and fifteenth, as also between the twenty first and
following third hour it will have its mean height; and be
lowest in the middle between the fifteenth and twenty first
hour, that is, at the moon’s rising. Thus here the water
will have but one flood and one ebb each day. When the
moon is on the other side of the equator, the flood will be
turned into ebb, and the ebb into flood; the high water falling
out at the rising of the moon, and the low water at
the setting. Now this is the case of the port of Batsham
in the kingdom of Tunquin in the East Indies; to which
port there are two inlets, one between the continent and the
islands which are called the Manillas, and the other between
the continent and Borneo.</p>

<p><a name="c296" id="c296">32.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> next thing to be considered is the effect, which
these fluids of the planets have upon the solid part of the
bodies to which they belong. And in the first place I
shall shew, that it was necessary upon account of these fluid
parts to form the bodies of the planets into a figure something
different from that of a perfect globe. Because the
diurnal rotation, which our earth performs about its axis,
and the like motion we see in some of the other planets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
(which is an ample conviction that they all do the like) will
diminish the force, with which bodies are attracted upon
all the parts of their surfaces, except at the very poles,
upon which they turn. Thus a stone or other weighty
substance resting upon the surface of the earth, by the
force which it receives from the motion communicated to
it by the earth, if its weight prevented not, would continue
that motion in a straight line from the point where
it received it, and according to the direction, in which it
was given, that is, in a line which touches the surface at
that point; insomuch that it would move off from the
earth in the same manner, as a weight fasten’d to a string
and whirled about endeavours continually to recede from
the center of motion, and would forthwith remove it self
to a greater distance from it, if loosed from the string which
retains it. And farther, as the centrifugal force, with which
such a weight presses from the center of its motion, is
greater, by how much greater the velocity is, with which
it moves; so such a body, as I have been supposing to lie
on the earth, would recede from it with the greater force,
the greater the velocity is, with which the part of the
earth’s surface it rests upon is moved, that is, the farther
distant it is from the poles. But now the power of gravity
is great enough to prevent bodies in any part of the earth
from being carried off from it by this means; however it is
plain that bodies having an effort contrary to that of gravity,
though much weaker than it, their weight, that is, the degree
of force, with which they are pressed to the earth,
will be diminished thereby, and be the more diminished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the greater this contrary effort is; or in other words, the
same body will weigh heavier at either of the poles, than
upon any other part of the earth; and if any body be
removed from the pole towards the equator, it will lose
of its weight more and more, and be lightest of all at
the equator, that is, in the middle between the poles.</p>

<p>33. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> now is easily applied to the waters of the seas,
and shews that the water under the poles will press more forcibly
to the earth, than at or near the equator: and consequently
that which presses least, must give place, till by ascending
it makes room for receiving a greater quantity, which by
its additional weight may place the whole upon a ballance.
To illustrate this more particularly I shall make use of fig. 116
In which let A&nbsp;C&nbsp;B&nbsp;D be a circle, by whose revolution about
the diameter A&nbsp;B a globe should be formed, representing a
globe of solid earth. Suppose this globe covered on all sides
with water to the same height, suppose that of E&nbsp;A or B&nbsp;F,
at which distance the circle E&nbsp;G&nbsp;F&nbsp;H surrounds the circle
A&nbsp;C&nbsp;B&nbsp;D; then it is evident, if the globe of earth be at rest,
the water which surrounds it will rest in that situation.
But if the globe be turned incessantly about its axis A&nbsp;B,
and the water have likewise the same motion, it is also
evident, from what has been explained, that the water between
the circles E&nbsp;H&nbsp;F&nbsp;G and A&nbsp;D&nbsp;B&nbsp;C will remain no longer
in the present situation, the parts of it between H and D, and
between G and C being by this rotation become lighter, than
the parts between E and A and between B and F; so that the
water over the poles A and B must of necessity subside, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
water be accumulated over D and C, till the greater quantity
in these latter places supply the defect of its weight.
This would be the case, were the globe all covered with
water. And the same figure of the surface would also be
preserved, if some part of the water adjoining to the globe
in any part of it were turned into solid earth, as is too
evident to need any proof; because the parts of the water
remaining at rest, it is the same thing, whether they continue
in the state of being easily separable, which denominates
them fluid, or were to be consolidated together, so
as to make a hard body: and this, though the water should
in some places be thus consolidated, even to the surface of it.
Which shews that the form of the solid part of the earth makes
no alteration in the figure the water will take: and by
consequence in order to the preventing some parts of the
earth from being entirely overflowed, and other parts
quite deserted, the solid parts of the earth must have given
them much the same figure, as if the whole earth were
covered on all sides with water.</p>

<p>34. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Farther</span>, I say, this figure of the earth is the
same, as it would receive, were it entirely a globe of water,
provided that water were of the same density as the substance
of the globe. For suppose the globe A&nbsp;C&nbsp;B&nbsp;D to be
liquified, and that the globe E&nbsp;H&nbsp;F&nbsp;G, now entirely water,
by its rotation about its axis should receive such a figure
as we have been describing, and then the globe A&nbsp;C&nbsp;B&nbsp;D
should be consolidated again, the figure of the water
would plainly not be altered, by such a consolidation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>35. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> from this last observation our author is enabled
to determine the proportion between the axis of the
earth drawn from pole to pole, and the diameter of the equator,
upon the supposition that all the parts of the earth are
of equal density; which he does by computing in the first
place the proportion of the centrifugal force of the parts under
the equator to the power of gravity; and then by considering
the earth as a spheroid, made by the revolution
of an ellipsis about its lesser axis, that is, supposing the
line M&nbsp;I&nbsp;L&nbsp;K to be an exact ellipsis, from which it can differ
but little, by reason that the difference between the
lesser axis M&nbsp;L and the greater I&nbsp;K is but very small. From
this supposition, and what was proved before, that all the
particles which compose the earth have the attracting power
explained in the preceding chapter, he finds at what distance
the parts under the equator ought to be removed from
the center, that the force, with which they shall be attracted
to the center, diminished by their centrifugal force, shall
be sufficient to keep those parts in a ballance with those which
lie under the poles. And upon the supposition of all the
parts of the earth having the same degree of density, the
earth’s surface at the equator must be above 17 miles more
distant from the center, than at the poles<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c300" id="c300">36.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> this it is shewn, from the proportion of the
equatorial diameter of the earth to its axis, how the same
may be determined of any other planet, whose density in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
comparison of the density of the earth, and the time of its
revolution about its axis, are known. And by the rule delivered
for this, it is found, that the diameter of the equator
in Jupiter should bear to its axis about the proportion
of 10 to 9<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>, and accordingly this planet appears of an oval
form to the astronomers.  The most considerable effects
of this spheroidical figure our author takes likewise
into consideration; one of which is that bodies are not equally
heavy in all distances from the poles; but near the equator,
where the distance from the center is greatest, they are
lighter than towards the poles: and nearly in this proportion,
that the actual power, by which they are drawn to the center,
resulting from the difference between their absolute gravity
and centrifugal force, is reciprocally as the distance from
the center.  That this may not appear to contradict what
has before been said of the alteration of the power of gravity,
in proportion to the change of the distance from the center,
it is proper carefully to remark, that our author has
demonstrated three things relating hereto: the first is, that
decrease of the power of gravity as we recede from the
center, which has been fully explained in the last chapter,
upon supposition that the earth and planets are perfect
spheres, from which their difference is by many degrees too
little to require notice for the purposes there intended: the
next is, that whether they be perfect spheres, or exactly such
spheroids as have now been mentioned, the power of gravity,
as we descend in the same line to the center, is at all
distances as the distance from the center, the parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
earth above the body by drawing the body towards them
lessening its gravitation towards the center<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>; and both
these assertions relate to gravity alone: the third is what
we mentioned in this place, that the actual force on different
parts of the surface, with which bodies are drawn to the
center, is in the proportion here assigned<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c302" id="c302">38.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> next effect of this figure of the earth is an
obvious consequence of the former: that pendulums of
the same length do not in different distances from the pole
make their vibrations in the same time; but towards the poles,
where the gravity is strongest, they move quicker than near
the equator, where they are less impelled to the center; and
accordingly pendulums, that measure the same time by their
vibrations, must be shorter near the poles than at a greater
distance. Both which deductions are found true in fact; of
which our author has recounted particularly several experiments,
in which it was found, that clocks exactly adjusted to
the true measure of time at Paris, when transported nearer to
the equator, became erroneous and moved too slow, but were
reduced to their true motion by contracting their pendulums.
Our author is particular in remarking, how much they lost of
their motion, while the pendulums remained unaltered; and
what length the observers are said to have shortened them, to
bring them to time. And the experiments, which appear
to be most carefully made, shew the earth to be raised in
the middle between the poles, as much as our author found
it by his computation<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>39. <span class="smcap gesperrt">These</span> experiments on the pendulum our author
has been very exact in examining, inquiring particularly
how much the extension of the rod of the pendulum by
the great heats in the torrid zone might make it necessary
to shorten it. For by an experiment made by <span class="smcap">Picart</span>, and
another made by <span class="smcap">De la Hire</span>, heat, though not very intense,
was found to increase the length of rods of iron. The experiment
of <span class="smcap">Picart</span> was made with a rod one foot long,
which in winter, at the time of frost, was found to increase
in length by being heated at the fire. In the experiment
of <span class="smcap">De la Hire</span> a rod of six foot in length was found,
when heated by the summer sun only, to grow to a greater
length, than it had in the aforesaid cold season. From which
observations a doubt has been raised, whether the rod of the
pendulums in the aforementioned experiments was not
extended by the heat of those warm climates to all that
excess of length, the observers found themselves obliged
to lessen them by. But the experiments now mentioned
shew the contrary. For in the first of them the rod of a
foot long was lengthened no more than 1/9 part of what the
pendulum under the equator must be diminished; and therefore
a rod of the length of the pendulum would not have been
extended above ⅓ of that length. In the experiment
of <span class="smcap">De la Hire</span>, where the heat was less, the rod of six foot
long was extended no more than 3/10 of what the pendulum
must be shortened; so that a rod of the length of the pendulum
would not have gained above 3/20 or 1/7 of that length.
And the heat in this latter experiment, though less than in the
former, was yet greater than the rod of a pendulum can ordinarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
contract in the hottest country; for metals receive a
great heat when exposed to the open sun, certainly much
greater than that of a human body. But pendulums are not
usually so exposed, and without doubt in these experiments
were kept cool enough to appear so to the touch; which they
would do in the hottest place, if lodged in the shade. Our
author therefore thinks it enough to allow about 1/10 of the
difference observed upon account of the greater warmth of
the pendulum.</p>

<p><a name="c304" id="c304">40.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> is a third effect, which the water has on the
earth by changing its figure, that is taken notice of by
our author; for the explaining of which we shall first prove,
that bodies descend perpendicularly to the surface of the
earth in all places. The manner of collecting this from observation,
is as follows. The surfaces of all fluids rest parallel
to that part of the surface of the sea, which is in the same
place with them, to the figure of which, as has been particularly
shewn, the figure of the whole earth is formed. For
if any hollow vessel, open at the bottom, be immersed into
the sea; it is evident, that the surface of the sea within the
vessel will retain the same figure it had, before the vessel
inclosed it; since its communication with the external water
is not cut off by the vessel. But all the parts of the water
being at rest, it is as clear, that if the bottom of the vessel
were closed, the figure of the water could receive no change
thereby, even though the vessel were raised out of the
sea; any more than from the insensible alteration of the
power of gravity, consequent upon the augmentation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the distance from the center. But now it is clear, that bodies
descend in lines perpendicular to the surfaces of quiescent fluids;
for if the power of gravity did not act perpendicularly
to the surface of fluids, bodies which swim on them
could not rest, as they are seen to do; because, if the power
of gravity drew such bodies in a direction oblique to the
surface whereon they lay, they would certainly be put in
motion, and be carried to the side of the vessel, in which
the fluid was contained, that way the action of gravity inclined.</p>

<p>41. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Hence</span> it follows, that as we stand, our bodies are
perpendicular to the surface of the earth. Therefore in
going from north to south our bodies do not keep in a
parallel direction. Now in all distances from the pole the
same length gone on the earth will not make the same
change in the position of our bodies, but the nearer we
are to the poles, we must go greater length to cause the
same variation herein. Let M&nbsp;I&nbsp;L&nbsp;K (in fig. 117) represent
the figure of the earth, M, L the poles, I, K two opposite
points in the middle between these poles. Let T&nbsp;V
and P&nbsp;O be two arches, T&nbsp;V being most remote from the pole
L; draw T&nbsp;W, V&nbsp;X, P&nbsp;Q, O&nbsp;R, each perpendicular to the
surface of the earth, and let T&nbsp;W, V&nbsp;X meet in Y, and
P&nbsp;Q, O&nbsp;R in S. Here it is evident, that in passing from V to
T the position of a man’s body would be changed by the
angle under T&nbsp;Y&nbsp;V, for at V he would stand in the line Y&nbsp;V
continued upward, and at T in the line Y&nbsp;T; but in passing
from O to P the position of his body would be changed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the angle under O&nbsp;S&nbsp;P. Now I say, if these two angles are
equal the arch O&nbsp;P is longer than T&nbsp;V: for the figure M&nbsp;I&nbsp;L&nbsp;K
being oblong, and I&nbsp;K longer than M&nbsp;L, the figure will be
more incurvated toward I than toward L; so that the lines
T&nbsp;W and V&nbsp;X will meet in Y before they are drawn out to
so great a length as the lines P&nbsp;Q and O&nbsp;R must be continued
to, before they will meet in S. Since therefore Y&nbsp;T and
Y&nbsp;V are shorter than P&nbsp;S and S&nbsp;V, T&nbsp;V must be less than O&nbsp;P.
If these angles under T&nbsp;Y&nbsp;V and O&nbsp;S&nbsp;P are each 1/90 part of
the angle made by a perpendicular line, they are said each
to contain one degree.  And the unequal length of these
arches O&nbsp;P and V&nbsp;T gives occasion to the assertion, that in
passing from north to south the degrees on the earth’s surface
are not of an equal length, but those near the pole
longer than those toward the equator. For the length of
the arch on the earth lying between the two perpendiculars,
which make an angle of a degree with each other, is
called the length of a degree on the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>42. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> figure of the earth has some effect on eclipses.
It has been observed above, that sometimes the nodes of the
moon’s orbit lie in a straight line drawn from the sun to
the earth; in which case the moon will cross the plane of
the earth’s motion at the new and full. But whenever the
moon passes near the plane at the full, some part of the
earth will intercept the sun’s light, and the moon shining
only with light borrow’d from the sun, when that light is
prevented from falling on any part of the moon, so much
of her body will be darkened. Also when the moon at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
new is near the plane of the earth’s motion, the inhabitants
on some part of the earth will see the moon come under
the sun, and the sun thereby be covered from them either
wholly or in part. Now the figure, which we have shewn
to belong to the earth, will occasion the shadow of the
earth on the moon not to be perfectly round, but cause the
diameter from east to west to be somewhat longer than the
diameter from north to south. In eclipse of the sun this
figure of the earth will make some little difference in the
place, where the sun shall appear wholly or in any given
part covered. Let A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D (in fig. 118.) represent the earth,
A&nbsp;C the axis whereon it turns daily, E the center. Let F&nbsp;A&nbsp;G&nbsp;C
represent a perfect globe inscribed within the earth. Let H&nbsp;I
be a line drawn through the centers of the sun and moon, crossing
the surface of the earth in K, and the surface of the
globe inscribed in L. Draw E&nbsp;L, which will be perpendicular
to the surface of the globe in L: and draw likewise K&nbsp;M,
so that it shall be perpendicular to the surface of the earth
in K. Now whereas the eclipse would appear central at L,
if the earth were the globe A&nbsp;G&nbsp;C&nbsp;F, and does really appear
so at K; I say, the latitude of the place K on the real earth
is different from the latitude of the place L on the globe
F&nbsp;A&nbsp;G&nbsp;C. What is called the latitude of any place is determined
by the angle which the line perpendicular to the surface of
the earth at that place makes with the axis; the difference
between this angle, and that made by a perpendicular line or
square being called the latitude of each place. But it might
here be proved, that the angle which K&nbsp;M makes with M&nbsp;C
is less, than the angle made between L&nbsp;E and E&nbsp;C: consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the latitude of the place K is greater, than the latitude,
which the place L would have.</p>

<p>43. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> next effect, which follows from this figure of
the earth, is that gradual change in the distance of the fixed
stars from the equinoctial points, which astronomers observe.
But before this can be explained, it is necessary to
say something more particular, than has yet been done,
concerning the manner of the earth’s motion round the sun.</p>

<p>44. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> has already been said, that the earth turns round
each day on its own axis, while its whole body is carried
round the sun once in a year. How these two motions
are joined together may be conceived in some degree by
the motion of a bowl on the ground, where the bowl in
rouling on continually turns upon its axis, and at the same
time the whole body thereof is carried straight on. But
to be more express let A (in fig. 119) represent the sun
B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E four different situations of the earth in its orbit
moving about the sun. In all these let F&nbsp;G represent the
axis, about which the earth daily turns. The points F, G
are called the poles of the earth; and this axis is supposed
to keep always parallel to it self in every situation of
the earth; at least that it would do so, were it not for a
minute deviation, the cause whereof will be explained in
what follows. When the earth is in B, the half H&nbsp;I&nbsp;K will
be illuminated by the sun, and the other half H&nbsp;L&nbsp;K will
be in darkness. Now if on the globe any point be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
in the middle between the poles, this point shall describe
by the motion of the globe the circle M&nbsp;N, half of which
is in the enlightened part of the globe, and half in the
dark part. But the earth is supposed to move round its axis
with an equable motion; therefore on this point of the
globe the sun will be seen just half the day, and be invisible
the other half. And the same will happen to every
point of this circle, in all situations of the earth during its
whole revolution round the sun. This circle M&nbsp;N is called
the equator, of which we have before made mention.</p>

<p>45. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> suppose any other point taken on the surface
of the globe toward the pole F, which in the diurnal revolution
of the globe shall describe the circle O&nbsp;P. Here
it appears that more than half this circle is enlightned by
the sun, and consequently that in any particular point of
this circle the sun will be longer seen than lie hid, that is
the day will be longer than the night. Again if we consider
the same circle O&nbsp;P on the globe situated in D the opposite
part of the orbit from B, we shall see, that here in
any place of this circle the night will be as much longer
than the day.</p>

<p>46. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> these situations of the globe of earth a line
drawn from the sun to the center of the earth will be
obliquely inclined toward the axis F&nbsp;G. Now suppose, that
such a line drawn from the sun to the center of the earth,
when in C or E, would be perpendicular to the axis F&nbsp;G;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
in which cases the sun will shine perpendicularly upon the
equator, and consequently the line drawn from the center
of the earth to the sun will cross the equator, as it passes
through the surface of the earth; whereas in all other situations
of the globe this line will pass through the surface
of the globe at a distance from the equator either northward
or southward. Now in both these cases half the circle
O&nbsp;P will be in the light, and half in the dark; and therefore
to every place in this circle the day will be equal
to the night. Thus it appears, that in these two opposite
situations of the earth the day is equal to the night in all
parts of the globe; but in all other situations this equality
will only be found in places situated in the very middle
between the poles, that is, on the equator.</p>

<p>47. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> times, wherein this universal equality between
the day and night happens, are called the equinoxes. Now
it has been long observed by astronomers, that after the
earth hath set out from either equinox, suppose from E
(which will be the spring equinox, if F be the north pole)
the same equinox shall again return a little before the earth
has made a compleat revolution round the sun. This return
of the equinox preceding the intire revolution of the
earth is called the precession of the equinox, and is caused
by the protuberant figure of the earth.</p>

<p>49. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Since</span> the sun shines perpendicularly upon the equator,
when the line drawn from the sun to the center
of the earth is perpendicular to the earth’s axis, in this case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
the plane, which should cut through the earth at the equator,
may be extended to pass through the sun; but it
will not do so in any other position of the earth. Now
let us consider the prominent part of the earth about the
equator, as a solid ring moving with the earth round the
sun. At the time of the equinoxes, this ring will have
the same kind of situation in respect of the sun, as the
orbit of the moon has, when the line of the nodes is directed
to the sun; and at all other times will resemble the
moon’s orbit in other situations. Consequently this ring,
which otherwise would keep throughout its motion parallel
to it self, will receive some change in its position from
the action of the sun upon it, except only at the time of
the equinox. The manner of this change may be understood
as follows. Let A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D (in fig. 120) represent this ring,
E the center of the earth, S the sun, A&nbsp;F&nbsp;C&nbsp;G a circle described
in the plane of the earth’s motion to the center E.
Here A and C are the two points, in which the earth’s equator
crosses the plane of the earth’s motion; and the time
of the equinox falls out, when the straight line A&nbsp;C continued
would pass through the sun. Now let us recollect
what was said above concerning the moon, when her orbit
was in the same situation with this ring. From thence
it will be understood, if a body were supposed to be moving
in any part of this circle A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D, what effect the action
of the sun on the body would have toward changing
the position of the line A&nbsp;C. In particular H&nbsp;I being drawn
perpendicular to S&nbsp;E, if the body be in any part of this
circle between A and H, or between C and I, the line A&nbsp;C<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
would be so turned, that the point A shall move toward B,
and the point C toward D; but if it were in any other part
of the circle, either between H and C, or between I and A,
the line A&nbsp;C would be turned the contrary way. Hence
it follows, that as this solid ring turns round the center
of the earth, the parts of this ring between A and H, and
between C and I, are so influenced by the sun, that they
will endeavour, so to change the situation of the line A&nbsp;C
as to cause the point A to move toward B, and the point
C to move toward D; but all the parts of the ring between
H and C, and between I and A, will have the opposite
tendency, and dispose the line A&nbsp;C to move the contrary
way. And since these last named parts are larger than
the other, they will prevail over the other, so that by the
action of the sun upon this ring, the line A&nbsp;C will be so
turned, that A shall continually be more and more moving
toward D, and C toward B. Thus no sooner shall the
sun in its visible motion have departed from A, but the motion
of the line A&nbsp;C shall hasten its meeting with C, and
from thence the motion of this line shall again hasten the
sun’s second conjunction with A; for as this line so turns,
that A is continually moving toward D, so the sun’s visible
motion is the same way as from S toward T.</p>

<p>49. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> moon will have on this ring the like effect as
the sun, and operate on it more strongly, in the same proportion
as its force on the sea exceeded that of the sun on the
same. But the effect of the action of both luminaries will
be greatly diminished by reason of this ring’s being connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
to the rest of the earth; for by this means the sun and
moon have not only this ring to move, but likewise the
whole globe of the earth, upon whose spherical part they have
no immediate influence. Beside the effect is also rendred
less, by reason that the prominent part of the earth is not
collected all under the equator, but spreads gradually from
thence toward both poles. Upon the whole, though the
sun alone carries the nodes of the moon through an intire
revolution in about 19 years, the united force of both luminaries
on the prominent parts of the earth will hardly
carry round the equinox in a less space of time than 26000
years.</p>

<p><a name="c313a" id="c313a">50.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">To</span> this motion of the equinox we must add another
consequence of this action of the sun and moon upon
the elevated parts of the earth, that this annular part of the
earth about the equator, and consequently the earth’s axis,
will twice a year and twice a month change its inclination
to the plane of the earth’s motion, and be again restored,
just as the inclination of the moon’s orbit by the action of
the sun is annually twice diminished, and as often recovers its
original magnitude. But this change is very insensible.</p>

<p><a name="c313b" id="c313b">51.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> now finish the present chapter with our great
author’s inquiry into the figure of the secondary planets, particularly
of our moon, upon the figure of which its fluid
parts will have an influence. The moon turns always the
same side towards the earth, and consequently revolves
but once round its axis in the space of an entire month;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
for a spectator placed without the circle, in which the moon
moves, would in that time observe all the parts of the moon
successively to pass once before his view and no more, that
is, that the whole globe of the moon has turned once round.
Now the great slowness of this motion will render the centrifugal
force of the parts of the waters very weak, so that
the figure of the moon cannot, as in the earth, be much affected
by this revolution upon its axis: but the figure of those
waters are made different from spherical by another cause,
viz. the action of the earth upon them; by which they will
be reduced to an oblong oval form, whose axis prolonged
would pass through the earth; for the same reason, as we
have above observed, that the waters of the earth would
take the like figure, if they had moved so slowly, as to keep
pace with the moon. And the solid part of the moon must
correspond with this figure of the fluid part: but this elevation
of the parts of the moon is nothing near so great as
is the protuberance of the earth at the equator, for it will not
exceed 93 english feet.</p>

<p>52. The waters of the moon will have no tide, except
what will arise from the motion of the moon round the
earth. For the conversion of the moon about her axis is equable,
whereby the inequality in the motion round the
earth discovers to us at some times small parts of the moon’s
surface towards the east or west, which at other times lie
hid; and as the axis, whereon the moon turns, is oblique to
her motion round the earth, sometimes small parts of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
surface toward the north, and sometimes the like toward
the south are visible, which at other times are out of sight.
These appearances make what is called the libration of the
moon, discovered by <span class="smcap">Hevelius</span>.  But now as the axis of
the oval figure of the waters will he pointed towards the
earth, there must arise from hence some fluctuation in them;
and beside, by the change of the moon’s distance from the
earth, they will not always have the very same height.</p>

</div>
<p class="cap13">AFTER this view which has been taken
of Sir <span class="smcap">Isaac Newton’s</span> mathematical
principles of philosophy, and the
use he has made of them, in explaining
the system of the world, &amp;c. the
course of my design directs us to turn
our eyes to that other philosophical
work, his treatise of Optics, in which we shall find our great
author’s inimitable genius discovering it self no less, than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the former; nay perhaps even more, since this work gives
as many instances of his singular force of reasoning, and
of his unbounded invention, though unassisted in great
measure by those rules and general precepts, which facilitate
the invention of mathematical theorems. Nor yet is
this work inferior to the other in usefulness; for as that
has made known to us one great principle in nature, by
which the celestial motions are continued, and by which
the frame of each globe is preserved; so does this point out
to us another principle no less universal, upon which depends
all those operations in the smaller parts of matter,
for whose sake the greater frame of the universe is erected;
all those immense globes, with which the whole heavens are
filled, being without doubt only design’d as so many convenient
apartments for carrying on the more noble operations
of nature in vegetation and animal life. Which single
consideration gives abundant proof of the excellency of
our author’s choice, in applying himself carefully to examine
the action between light and bodies, so necessary
in all the varieties of these productions, that none of them
can be successfully promoted without the concurrence of
heat in a greater or less degree.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap gesperrt">’Tis</span> true, our author has not made so full a discovery
of the principle, by which this mutual action between light
and bodies is caused; as he has in relation to the power, by
which the planets are kept in their courses: yet he has led
us to the very entrance upon it, and pointed out the path
so plainly which must be followed to reach it; that one may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
be bold to say, whenever mankind shall be blessed with this
improvement of their knowledge, it will be derived so directly
from the principles laid down by our author in this
book, that the greatest share of the praise due to the discovery
will belong to him.</p>

<p><a name="c318" id="c318">3.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> speaking of the progress our author has made,
I shall distinctly pursue three things, the two first relating
to the colours of natural bodies: for in the first head shall
be shewn, how those colours are derived from the properties
of the light itself; and in the second upon what
properties of the bodies they depend: but the third head
of my discourse shall treat of the action of bodies upon
light in refracting, reflecting, and inflecting it.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> first of these, which shall be the business of
the present chapter, is contained in this one proposition: that
the sun’s direct light is not uniform in respect of colour, not
being disposed in every part of it to excite the idea of whiteness,
which the whole raises; but on the contrary is a composition
of different kinds of rays, one sort of which if alone
would give the sense of red, another of orange, a
third of yellow, a fourth of green, a fifth of light blue,
a sixth of indigo, and a seventh of a violet purple; that
all these rays together by the mixture of their sensations
impress upon the organ of sight the sense of whiteness,
though each ray always imprints there its own colour; and
all the difference between the colours of bodies when viewed
in open day light arises from this, that coloured bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
do not reflect all the sorts of rays falling upon them in equal
plenty, but some sorts much more copiously than others;
the body appearing of that colour, of which the
light coming from it is most composed.</p>

<p><a name="c319" id="c319">5.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">That</span> the light of the sun is compounded, as has been
said, is proved by refracting it with a prism. By a prism I here
mean a glass or other body of a triangular form, such as is represented
in fig. 121. But before we proceed to the illustration
of the proposition we have just now laid down, it will be necessary
to spend a few words in explaining what is meant by
the refraction of light; as the design of our present labour is
to give some notion of the subject, we are engaged in, to
such as are not versed in the mathematics.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is well known, that when a ray of light passing
through the air falls obliquely upon the surface of any transparent
body, suppose water or glass, and enters it, the ray
will not pass on in that body in the same line it described
through the air, but be turned off from the surface, so
as to be less inclined to it after passing it, than before. Let
A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D (in fig. 122.) represent a portion of water, or glass,
A&nbsp;B the surface of it, upon which the ray of light E&nbsp;F falls
obliquely; this ray shall not go right on in the course delineated
by the line F&nbsp;G, but be turned off from the surface
A&nbsp;B into the line F&nbsp;H, less inclined to the surface A&nbsp;B
than the line E&nbsp;F is, in which the ray is incident upon that
surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">On</span> the other hand, when the light passes out of any
such body into the air, it is inflected the contrary way,
being after its emergence rendred more oblique to the surface
it passes through, than before. Thus the ray F&nbsp;H, when
it goes out of the surface C&nbsp;D, will be turned up towards
that surface, going out into the air in the line H&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> turning of the light out of its way, as it passes
from one transparent body into another is called its refraction.
Both these cases may be tried by an easy experiment with
a bason and water. For the first case set an empty bason
in the sunshine or near a candle, making a mark upon
the bottom at the extremity of the shadow cast by the brim
of the bason, then by pouring water into the bason you
will observe the shadow to shrink, and leave the bottom
of the bason enlightned to a good distance from the mark.
Let A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C (in fig. 123.) denote the empty bason, E&nbsp;A&nbsp;D the
light shining over the brim of it, so that all the part A&nbsp;B&nbsp;D
be shaded. Then a mark being made at D, if water be
poured into the bason (as in fig. 124.) to F&nbsp;G, you shall observe
the light, which before went on to D, now to come
much short of the mark D, falling on the bottom in the
point H, and leaving the mark D a good way within the
enlightened part; which shews that the ray E&nbsp;A, when it
enters the water at I, goes no longer straight forwards, but
is at that place incurvated, and made to go nearer the
perpendicular.  The other case may be tryed by putting
any small body into an empty bason, placed lower than your
eye, and then receding from the bason, till you can but just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
see the body over the brim. After which, if the bason be
filled with water, you shall presently observe the body to be
visible, though you go farther off from the bason. Let
A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C (in fig. 125.) denote the bason as before, D the body
in it, E the place of your eye, when the body is seen just
over the edge A, while the bason is empty. If it be then
filled with water, you will observe the body still to be visible,
though you take your eye farther off. Suppose you see
the body in this case just over the brim A, when your eye
is at F, it is plain that the rays of light, which come from
the body to your eye have not come straight on, but are
bent at A, being turned downwards, and more inclined to
the surface of the water, between A and your eye at F,
than they are between A and the body D.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> we hope is sufficient to make all our readers
apprehend, what the writers of optics mean, when they
mention the refraction of the light, or speak of the rays of
light being refracted. We shall therefore now go on to prove
the assertion advanced in the forementioned proposition, in
relation to the different kinds of colours, that the direct light
of the sun exhibits to our sense: which may be done in
the following manner.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> a room be darkened, and the sun permitted to
shine into it through a small hole in the window shutter, and
be made immediately to fall upon a glass prism, the beam of
light shall in passing through such a prism be parted into rays,
which exhibit all the forementioned colours. In this manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
if A&nbsp;B (in fig. 126) represent the window shutter; C the
hole in it; D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F the prism; Z&nbsp;Y a beam of light coming
from the sun, which passes through the hole, and falls upon
the prism at Y, and if the prism were removed would
go on to X, but in entring the surface B&nbsp;F of the glass it
shall be turned off, as has been explained, into the course Y&nbsp;W
falling upon the second surface of the prism D&nbsp;F in W,
going out of which into the air it shall be again farther inflected.
Let the light now, after it has passed the prism, be
received upon a sheet of paper held at a proper distance,
and it shall paint upon the paper the picture, image, or spectrum
L&nbsp;M of an oblong figure, whose length shall much exceed
its breadth; though the figure shall not be oval, the
ends L and M being semicircular and the sides straight.
But now this figure will be variegated with colours in this
manner. From the extremity M to some length, suppose
to the line <i>n&nbsp;o</i>, it shall be of an intense red; from <i>n&nbsp;o</i> to
<i>p&nbsp;q</i> it shall be an orange; from <i>p&nbsp;q</i> to <i>r&nbsp;s</i> it shall be yellow;
from thence to <i>t&nbsp;u</i> it shall be green; from thence to
<i>w&nbsp;x</i> blue; from thence to <i>y&nbsp;z</i> indigo; and from thence
to the end violet.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> it appears that the sun’s white light by its passage
through the prism, is so changed as now to be divided
into rays, which exhibit all these several colours. The
question is, whether the rays while in the sun’s beam before
this refraction possessed these properties distinctly; so
that some part of that beam would without the rest have
given a red colour, and another part alone have given an..orange, &amp;c. That this is possible to be the case, appears from
hence; that if a convex glass be placed between the paper
and the prism, which may collect all the rays proceeding
out of the prism into its focus, as a burning glass does the
sun’s direct rays; and if that focus fall upon the paper, the
spot formed by such a glass upon the paper shall appear
white, just like the sun’s direct light.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-389.jpg" width="400" height="513"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>The rest remaining
as before, let P&nbsp;Q. (in fig. 127.) be the convex glass, causing
the rays to meet upon the paper H&nbsp;G&nbsp;I&nbsp;K in the point
N, I say that point or rather spot of light shall appear white,
without the least tincture of any colour.  But it is evident
that into this spot are now gathered all those rays, which before
when separate gave all those different colours; which
shews that whiteness may be made by mixing those colours:
especially if we consider, it can be proved that the glass
P&nbsp;Q does not alter the colour of the rays which pass
through it. Which is done thus: if the paper be made
to approach the glass P&nbsp;Q, the colours will manifest themselves
as far as the magnitude of the spectrum, which the
paper receives, will permit. Suppose it in the situation <i>h&nbsp;g&nbsp;i&nbsp;k</i>,
and that it then receive the spectrum <i>l&nbsp;m</i>, this spectrum
shall be much smaller, than if the glass P&nbsp;Q were removed,
and therefore the colours cannot be so much separated; but
yet the extremity <i>m</i> shall manifestly appear red, and
the other extremity <i>l</i> shall be blue; and these colours as
well as the intermediate ones shall discover themselves more
perfectly, the farther the paper is removed from N, that
is, the larger the spectrum is: the same thing happens, if
the paper be removed farther off from P&nbsp;Q than N. Suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
into the position θ&nbsp;γ&nbsp;η&nbsp;ϰ, the spectrum λ&nbsp;μ painted upon it
shall again discover its colours, and that more distinctly, the
farther the paper is removed, but only in an inverted order:
for as before, when the paper was nearer the convex
glass, than at N, the upper part of the image was
blue, and the under red; now the upper part shall be red,
and the under blue: because the rays cross at N.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Nay</span> farther that the whiteness at the focus N, is made
by the union of the colours may be proved without removing
the paper out of the focus, by intercepting with
any opake body part of the light near the glass; for if the
under part, that is the red, or more properly the red-making
rays, as they are styled by our author, are intercepted, the
spot shall take a bluish hue; and if more of the inferior
rays are cut off, so that neither the red-making nor orange-making
rays, and if you please the yellow-making rays likewise,
shall fall upon the spot; then shall the spot incline more
and more to the remaining colours. In like manner if you
cut off the upper part of the rays, that is the violet coloured
or indigo-making rays, the spot shall turn reddish, and become,
more so, the more of those opposite colours are intercepted.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> I think abundantly proves that whiteness may
be produced by a mixture of all the colours of the spectrum.
At least there is but one way of evading the present
arguments, which is, by asserting that the rays of light
after passing the prism have no different properties to exhibit
this or the other colour, but are in that respect perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
homogeneal, so that the rays which pass to the under
and red part of the image do not differ in any properties
whatever from those, which go to the upper and
violet part of it; but that the colours of the spectrum are
produced only by some new modifications of the rays, made
at their incidence upon the paper by the different terminations
of light and shadow: if indeed this assertion can
be allowed any place, after what has been said; for it seems
to be sufficiently obviated by the latter part of the preceding
experiment, that by intercepting the inferior part
of the light, which comes from the prism, the white spot
shall receive a bluish cast, and by stopping the upper part the
spot shall turn red, and in both cases recover its colour, when
the intercepted light is permitted to pass again; though
in all these trials there is the like termination of light and
shadow. However our author has contrived some experiments
expresly to shew the absurdity of this supposition;
all which he has explained and enlarged upon in so distinct
and expressive a manner, that it would be wholly unnecessary
to repeat them in this place<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>. I shall only mention
that of them, which may be tried in the experiment
before us. If you draw upon the paper H&nbsp;G&nbsp;I&nbsp;K, and through
the spot N, the straight line <i>w&nbsp;x</i> parallel to the horizon,
and then if the paper be much inclined into the situation
<i>r&nbsp;s&nbsp;v&nbsp;t</i> the line <i>w&nbsp;x</i> still remaining parallel to the horizon,
the spot N shall lose its whiteness and receive a blue tincture;
but if it be inclined as much the contrary way, the
same spot shall exchange its white colour for a reddish dye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
All which can never be accounted for by any difference in
the termination of the light and shadow, which here is
none at all; but are easily explained by supposing the upper
part of the rays, whenever they enter the eye, disposed
to give the sensation of the dark colours blue, indigo and
violet; and that the under part is fitted to produce the
bright colours yellow, orange and red: for when the paper
is in the situation <i>r&nbsp;s&nbsp;t&nbsp;u</i>, it is plain that the upper part of
the light falls more directly upon it, than the under part,
and therefore those rays will be most plentifully reflected
from it; and by their abounding in the reflected light will
cause it to incline to their colour. Just so when the paper
is inclined the contrary way, it will receive the inferior rays
most directly, and therefore ting the light it reflects with their
colour.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is now to be proved that these dispositions of the
rays of light to produce some one colour and some another,
which manifest themselves after their being refracted, are not
wrought by any action of the prism upon them, but are
originally inherent in those rays; and that the prism only
affords each species an occasion of shewing its distinct quality
by separating them one from another, which before,
while they were blended together in the direct beam of the
sun’s light, lay conceal’d. But that this is so, will be proved,
if it can be shewn that no prism has any power upon
the rays, which after their passage through one prism are
rendered uncompounded and contain in them but one colour,
either to divide that colour into several, as the sun’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
light is divided, or so much as to change it into any other
colour. This will be proved by the following experiment<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>.
The same thing remaining, as in the first experiment, let
another prism N&nbsp;O (in fig. 128.) be placed either immediately,
or at some distance after the first, in a perpendicular
posture, so that it shall refract the rays issuing from the
first sideways. Now if this prism could divide the light
falling upon it into coloured rays, as the first has done, it
would divide the spectrum breadthwise into colours, as
before it was divided lengthwise; but no such thing is observed.
If L&nbsp;M were the spectrum, which the first prism
D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F would paint upon the paper H&nbsp;G&nbsp;I&nbsp;K; P&nbsp;Q lying in
an oblique posture shall be the spectrum projected by the
second, and shall be divided lengthwise into colours corresponding
to the colours of the spectrum L&nbsp;M, and occasioned
like them by the refraction of the first prism, but
its breadth shall receive no such division; on the contrary
each colour shall be uniform from side to side, as much
as in the spectrum L&nbsp;M, which proves the whole assertion.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> same is yet much farther confirmed by another
experiment. Our author teaches that the colours of
the spectrum L&nbsp;M in the first experiment are yet compounded,
though not so much as in the sun’s direct light. He
shews therefore how, by placing the prism at a distance from
the hole, and by the use of a convex glass, to separate the
colours of the spectrum, and make them uncompounded
to any degree of exactness<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>. And he shews when this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
is done sufficiently, if you make a small hole in the paper
whereon the spectrum is received, through which any one sort
of rays may pass, and then let that coloured ray fall so upon a
prism, as to be refracted by it, it shall in no case whatever
change its colour; but shall always retain it perfectly as at
first, however it be refracted<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Nor</span> yet will these colours after this full separation
of them suffer any change by reflection from bodies of different
colours; on the other hand they make all bodies placed
in these colours appear of the colour which falls upon
them<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>: for minium in red light will appear as in open day
light; but in yellow light will appear yellow; and which
is more extraordinary, in green light will appear green, in blue,
blue; and in the violet-purple coloured light will appear of a
purple colour; in like manner verdigrease, or blue bise, will
put on the appearance of that colour, in which it is placed;
so that neither bise placed in the red light shall be able to
give that light the least blue tincture, or any other different
from red; nor shall minium in the indigo or violet
light exhibit the least appearance of red, or any other colour
distinct from that it is placed in. The only difference
is, that each of these bodies appears most luminous and bright
in the colour, which corresponds with that it exhibits in
the day light, and dimmed in the colours most remote from
that; that is, though minium and bise placed in blue light
shall both appear blue, yet the bise shall appear of a bright
blue, and the minium of a dusky and obscure blue: but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
if minium and bise be compared together in red light, the
minium shall afford a brisk red, the bise a duller colour,
though of the same species.</p>

<p><a name="c329" id="c329">17.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">And</span> this not only proves the immutability of all
these simple and uncompounded colours; but likewise unfolds
the whole mystery, why bodies appear in open day-light
of such different colours, it consisting in nothing more
than this, that whereas the white light of the day is composed
of all sorts of colours, some bodies reflect the rays
of one sort in greater abundance than the rays of any other<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>.
Though it appears by the fore-cited experiment, that almost
all these bodies reflect some portion of the rays of every
colour, and give the sense of particular colours only by the
predominancy of some sorts of rays above the rest. And what
has before been explained of composing white by mingling
all the colours of the spectrum together shews clearly, that
nothing more is required to make bodies look white, than
a power to reflect indifferently rays of every colour. But
this will more fully appear by the following method: if
near the coloured spectrum in our first experiment a piece
of white paper be so held, as to be illuminated equally by
all the parts of that spectrum, it shall appear white; whereas
if it be held nearer to the red end of the image, than to the
other, it shall turn reddish; if nearer the blue end, it shall
seem bluish<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> indefatigable and circumspect author farther
examined his theory by mixing the powders which painters
use of several colours, in order if possible to produce
a white powder by such a composition<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>.  But in this he
found some difficulties for the following reasons.  Each
of these coloured powders reflects but part of the light, which
is cast upon them; the red powders reflecting little green
or blue, and the blue powders reflecting very little red or
yellow, nor the green powders reflecting near so much of
the red or indigo and purple, as of the other colours: and
besides, when any of these are examined in homogeneal light,
as our author calls the colours of the prism, when well separated,
though each appears more bright and luminous in
its own day-light colour, than in any other; yet white bodies,
suppose white paper for instance, in those very colours
exceed these coloured bodies themselves in brightness; so
that white bodies reflect not only more of the whole light
than coloured bodies do in the day-light, but even more
of that very colour which they reflect most copiously. All
which considerations make it manifest that a mixture of these
will not reflect so great a quantity of light, as a white body of
the same size; and therefore will compose such a colour as
would result from a mixture of white and black, such as
are all grey and dun colours, rather than a strong white.
Now such a colour he compounded of certain ingredients,
which he particularly sets down, in so much that when the
composition was strongly illuminated by the sun’s direct
beams, it would appear much whiter than even white paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
if considerably shaded. Nay he found by trials how
to proportion the degree of illumination of the mixture
and paper, so that to a spectator at a proper distance it
could not well be determined which was the more perfect
colour; as he experienced not only by himself, but by the
concurrent opinion of a friend, who chanced to visit him
while he was trying this experiment. I must not here omit
another method of trying the whiteness of such a mixture,
proposed in one of our author’s letters on this subject<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>:
which is to enlighten the composition by a beam of
the sun let into a darkened room, and then to receive the
light reflected from it upon a piece of white paper, observing
whether the paper appears white by that reflection;
for if it does, it gives proof of the composition’s being white;
because when the paper receives the reflection from any
coloured body, it looks of that colour. Agreeable to this
is the trial he made upon water impregnated with soap,
and agitated into a froth<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>: for when this froth after some
short time exhibited upon the little bubbles, which composed
it, a great variety of colours, though these colours to a
spectator at a small distance discover’d themselves distinctly;
yet when the eye was so far removed, that each little bubble
could no longer be distinguished, the whole froth by
the mixture of all these colours appeared intensly white.</p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> author having fully satisfied himself by these
and many other experiments, what the result is of mixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
together all the prismatic colours; he proceeds in the next
place to examine, whether this appearance of whiteness be
raised by the rays of these different kinds acting so, when
they meet, upon one another, as to cause each of them to
impress the sense of whiteness upon the optic nerve; or whether
each ray does not make upon the organ of sight the
same impression, as when separate and alone; so that the
idea of whiteness is not excited by the impression from any
one part of the rays, but results from the mixture of all those
different sensations. And that the latter sentiment is the
true one, he evinces by undeniable experiments.</p>

<p>20. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> particular the foregoing experiment<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>, wherein
the convex glass was used, furnishes proofs of this: in that
when the paper is brought into the situation θ&nbsp;γ&nbsp;η&nbsp;ϰ, beyond, beyond
N the colours, that at N disappeared, begin to emerge again;
which shews that by mingling at N they did not lose their
colorific qualities, though for some reason they lay concealed.
This farther appears by that part of the experiment,
when the paper, while in the focus, was directed to be enclined
different ways; for when the paper was in such a
situation, that it must of necessity reflect the rays, which
before their arrival at the point N would have given a blue
colour, those rays in this very point itself by abounding in
the reflected light tinged it with the same colour; so when the
paper reflects most copiously the rays, which before they
come to the point N exhibit redness, those same rays tincture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the light reflected by the paper from that very point
with their own proper colour.</p>

<p>21. <span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> is a certain condition relating to sight, which
affords an opportunity of examining this still more fully:
it is this, that the impressions of light remain some short
space upon the eye; as when a burning coal is whirl’d about
in a circle, if the motion be very quick, the eye shall not
be able to distinguish the coal, but shall see an entire circle
of fire. The reason of which appearance is, that the impression
made by the coal upon the eye in any one situation
is not worn out, before the coal returns again to the same
place, and renews the sensation. This gives our author the
hint to try, whether these colours might not be transmitted
successively to the eye so quick, that no one of the colours
should be distinctly perceived, but the mixture of the sensations
should produce a uniform whiteness; when the rays
could not act upon each other, because they never should
meet, but come to the eye one after another. And this thought
he executed by the following expedient<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>. He made an instrument
in shape like a comb, which he applied near the
convex glass, so that by moving it up and down slowly
the teeth of it might intercept sometimes one and sometimes
another colour; and accordingly the light reflected from the
paper, placed at N, should change colour continually. But
now when the comb-like instrument was moved very quick,
the eye lost all preception of the distinct colours, which came
to it from time to time, a perfect whiteness resulting from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
mixture of all those distinct impressions in the sensorium.
Now in this case there can be no suspicion of the several
coloured rays acting upon one another, and making any
change in each other’s manner of affecting the eye, seeing
they do not so much as meet together there.</p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> author farther teaches us how to view the spectrum
of colours produced in the first experiment with another
prism, so that it shall appear to the eye under the
shape of a round spot and perfectly white<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>. And in this
case if the comb be used to intercept alternately some of
the colours, which compose the spectrum, the round spot
shall change its colour according to the colours intercepted;
but if the comb be moved too swiftly for those changes to
be distinctly perceived, the spot shall seem always white, as
before<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c334" id="c334">23.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Besides</span> this whiteness, which results from an universal
composition of all sorts of colours, our author particularly
explains the effects of other less compounded mixtures;
some of which compound other colours like some
of the simple ones, but others produce colours different from
any of them. For instance, a mixture of red and yellow
compound a colour like in appearance to the orange, which
in the spectrum lies between them; as a composition of yellow
and blue is made use of in all dyes to make a green.
But red and violet purple compounded make purples unlike
to any of the prismatic colours, and these joined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
yellow or blue make yet new colours. Besides one rule is here
to be observed, that when many different colours are mixed, the
colour which arises from the mixture grows languid and degenerates
into whiteness. So when yellow green and blue
are mixed together, the compound will be green; but if
to this you add red and purple, the colour shall first grow dull
and less vivid, and at length by adding more of these colours
it shall turn to whiteness, or some other colour<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>.</p>

<p>24. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Only</span> here is one thing remarkable of those compounded
colours, which are like in appearance to the simple
ones; that the simple ones when viewed through a prism shall
still retain their colour, but the compounded colours seen
through such a glass shall be parted into the simple ones of
which they are the aggregate. And for this reason any body
illuminated by the simple light shall appear through a prism
distinctly, and have its minutest parts observable, as may easily
be tried with flies, or other such little bodies, which have
very small parts; but the same viewed in this manner when
enlighten’d with compounded colours shall appear confused,
their smallest parts not being distinguishable. How the
prism separates these compounded colours, as likewise how
it divides the light of the sun into its colours, has not yet
been explained; but is reserved for our third chapter.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the mean time what has been said, I hope, will
suffice to give a taste of our author’s way of arguing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
in some measure to illustrate the proposition laid down in
this chapter.</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> are methods of separating the heterogeneous
rays of the sun’s light by reflection, which perfectly
conspire with and confirm this reasoning.  One of which
ways may be this. Let A&nbsp;B (in fig. 129) represent the window
shutter of a darkened room; C a hole to let in the sun’s
rays; D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F, G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I two prisms so applied together, that the
sides E&nbsp;F and G&nbsp;I be contiguous, and the sides D&nbsp;F, G&nbsp;H
parallel; by this means the light will pass through them without
any separation into colours: but if it be afterwards received
by a third prism I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L, it shall be divided so as to
form upon any white body P&nbsp;Q the usual colours, violet
at <i>m</i>, blue at <i>n</i>, green at <i>o</i>, yellow at <i>r</i>, and red at <i>s</i>. But
because it never happens that the two adjacent surfaces E&nbsp;F
and G&nbsp;I perfectly touch, part only of the light incident upon
the surface E&nbsp;F shall be transmitted, and part shall be
reflected. Let now the reflected part be received by a fourth
prism Δ&nbsp;Θ&nbsp;Λ, and passing through it paint upon a white body
Ζ&nbsp;Γ the colours of the prism, red at <i>t</i>, yellow at <i>u</i>, green
at <i>w</i>, blue at <i>x</i>, violet at <i>y</i>. If the prisms D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F, G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I
be slowly turned about while they remain contiguous, the
colours upon the body P&nbsp;Q shall not sensibly change their
situation, till such time as the rays become pretty oblique
to the surface E&nbsp;F; but then the light incident upon the
surface E&nbsp;F shall begin to be wholly reflected. And first
of all the violet light shall be wholly reflected, and thereupon
will disappear at <i>m</i>, appearing instead thereof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
at <i>y</i>, and increasing the violet light falling there, the
other colours remaining as before. If the prisms D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F, G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I
be turned a little farther about, that the incident rays become
yet more inclined to the surface E&nbsp;F, the blue shall
be totally reflected, and shall disappear in <i>n</i>, but appear at
<i>x</i> by making the colour there more intense. And the same
may be continued, till all the colours are successively removed
from the surface P&nbsp;Q to Ζ&nbsp;Γ. But in any case, suppose
when the violet and the blue have forsaken the surface P&nbsp;Q, and
appear upon the surface Ζ&nbsp;Γ, Ζ&nbsp;Γ, the green, yellow, and red only
remaining upon the surface P&nbsp;Q; if the light be received upon
a paper held any where in its whole passage between the
light’s coming out of the prisms D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F, G&nbsp;I&nbsp;H and its incidence
upon the prism I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L, it shall appear of the colour
compounded of all the colours seen upon P&nbsp;Q; and the reflected
ray, received upon a piece of white paper held any
where between the prisms D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F and Δ&nbsp;Θ&nbsp;Σ shall exhibit the colour
compounded of those the surface P&nbsp;Q is deprived of mixed
with the sun’s light: whereas before any of the light was reflected
from the surface E&nbsp;F, the rays between the prisms G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I and
I&nbsp;K&nbsp;L would appear white; as will likewise the reflected ray
both before and after the total reflection, provided the difference
of refraction by the surfaces D&nbsp;F and D&nbsp;E be inconsiderable.
I call here the sun’s light white, as I have all along done; but it
is more exact to ascribe to it something of a yellowish tincture,
occasioned by the brighter colours abounding in it; which
caution is necessary in examining the colours of the reflected
beam, when all the violet and blue are in it: for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
yellowish turn of the sun’s light causes the blue not to be
quite so visible in it, as it should be, were the light perfectly
white; but makes the beam of light incline rather towards
a pale white.</p>

Of the properties of BODIES, upon which
their COLOURS depend.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap16">AFTER having shewn in the last chapter, that the
difference between the colours of bodies viewed in open
day-light is only this, that some bodies are disposed to
reflect rays of one colour in the greatest plenty, and other
bodies rays of some other colour; order now requires us
to examine more particularly into the property of bodies,
which gives them this difference.  But this our author shews
to be nothing more, than the different magnitude of the
particles, which compose each body: this I question not
will appear no small paradox. And indeed this whole chapter
will contain scarce any assertions, but what will be almost
incredible, though the arguments for them are so strong
and convincing, that they force our assent. In the former
chapter have been explained properties of light, not in the
least thought of before our author’s discovery of them; yet
are they not difficult to admit, as soon as experiments are
known to give proof of their reality; but some of the propositions
to be stated here will, I fear, be accounted almost
past belief; notwithstanding that the arguments, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
they are established are unanswerable. For it is proved by
our author, that bodies are rendered transparent by the minuteness
of their pores, and become opake by having them large;
and more, that the most transparent body by being reduced
to a great thinness will become less pervious to the light.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> whereas it had been the received opinion, and
yet remains so among all who have not studied this philosophy,
that light is reflected from bodies by its impinging
against their solid parts, rebounding from them, as a tennis
ball or other elastic substance would do, when struck against
any hard and resisting surface; it will be proper to
begin with declaring our author’s sentiment concerning this,
who shews by many arguments that reflection cannot be
caused by any such means<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>: some few of his proofs I shall
set down, referring the reader to our author himself for
the rest.</p>

<p><a name="c339" id="c339">3.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is well known, that when light falls upon any
transparent body, glass for instance, part of it is reflected and
part transmitted; for which it is ready to account, by saying
that part of the light enters the pores of the glass, and
part impinges upon its solid parts. But when the transmitted
light arrives at the farther surface of the glass, in passing
out of glass into air there is as strong a reflection caused,
or rather something stronger. Now it is not to be conceived,
how the light should find as many solid parts in the
air to strike against as in the glass, or even a greater number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
of them. And to augment the difficulty, if water
be placed behind the glass, the reflection becomes much
weaker. Can we therefore say, that water has fewer solid
parts for the light to strike against, than the air? And if
we should, what reason can be given for the reflection’s being
stronger, when the air by the air-pump is removed
from behind the glass, than when the air receives the rays
of light. Besides the light may be so inclined to the hinder
surface of the glass, that it shall wholly be reflected,
which happens when the angle which the ray makes with
the surface does not exceed about 49⅓ degrees; but if the
inclination be a very little increased, great part of the light
will be transmitted; and how the light in one case should
meet with nothing but the solid parts of the air, and by
so small a change of its inclination find pores in great plenty,
is wholly inconceivable. It cannot be said, that the light
is reflected by striking against the solid parts of the surface
of the glass; because without making any change in that
surface, only by placing water contiguous to it instead of
air, great part of that light shall be transmitted, which could
find no passage through the air. Moreover in the last experiment
recited in the preceding chapter, when by turning
the prisms D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F, G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I, the blue light became wholly
reflected, while the rest was mostly transmitted, no possible
reason can be assigned, why the blue-making rays should
meet with nothing but the solid parts of the air between
the prisms, and the rest of the light in the very same obliquity
find pores in abundance. Nay farther, when two glasses
touch each other, no reflection at all is made; though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
it does not in the least appear, how the rays should avoid
the solid parts of glass, when contiguous to other glass, any
more than when contiguous to air. But in the last place
upon this supposition it is not to be comprehended, how
the most polished substances could reflect the light in that
regular manner we find they do; for when a polished looking
glass is covered over with quicksilver, we cannot suppose
the particles of light so much larger than those of the quicksilver
that they should not be scattered as much in reflection,
as a parcel of marbles thrown down upon a rugged pavement.
The only cause of so uniform and regular a reflection must be
some more secret cause, uniformly spread over the whole surface
of the glass.</p>

<p><a name="c341" id="c341">4.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> now, since the reflection of light from bodies
does not depend upon its impinging against their solid parts,
some other reason must be sought for. And first it is
past doubt that the least parts of almost all bodies are transparent,
even the microscope shewing as much<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>; besides that
it may be experienced by this method. Take any thin plate
of the opakest body, and apply it to a small hole designed
for the admission of light into a darkened room; however
opake that body may seem in open day-light, it shall under
these circumstances sufficiently discover its transparency,
provided only the body be very thin. White metals indeed
do not easily shew themselves transparent in these trials, they
reflecting almost all the light incident upon them at their
first superficies; the cause of which will appear in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
follows<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>. But yet these substances, when reduced into parts
of extraordinary minuteness by being dissolved in aqua fortis
or the like corroding liquors do also become transparent.</p>

<p><a name="c342" id="c342">5.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Since</span> therefore the light finds free passage through
the least parts of bodies, let us consider the largeness of
their pores, and we shall find, that whenever a ray of light
has passed through any particle of a body, and is come
to its farther surface, if it finds there another particle contiguous,
it will without interruption pass into that particle;
just as light will pass through one piece of glass into another
piece in contact with it without any impediment, or
any part being reflected: but as the light in passing out of
glass, or any other transparent body, shall part of it be reflected
back, if it enter into air or other transparent body
of a different density from that it passes out of; the same
thing will happen in the light’s passage through any particle
of a body, whenever at its exit out of that particle it
meets no other particle contiguous, but must enter into a
pore, for in this case it shall not all pass through, but part
of it be reflected back. Thus will the light, every time it
enters a pore, be in part reflected; so that nothing more
seems necessary to opacity, than that the particles, which compose
any body, touch but in very few places, and that the
pores of it are numerous and large, so that the light may
in part be reflected from it, and the other part, which enters
too deep to be returned out of the body, by numerous
reflections may be stifled and lost<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>; which in all probability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
happens, as often as it impinges against the solid part
of the body, all the light which does so not being reflected
back, but stopt, and deprived of any farther motion<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> notion of opacity is greatly confirmed by the
observation, that opake bodies become transparent by filling
up the pores with any substance of near the same density
with their parts. As when paper is wet with water or
oyl; when linnen cloth is either dipt in water, oyled, or
varnished; or the oculus mundi stone steeped in water<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>.
All which experiments confirm both the first assertion, that
light is not reflected by striking upon the solid parts of
bodies; and also the second, that its passage is obstructed
by the reflections it undergoes in the pores; since we find
it in these trials to pass in greater abundance through bodies,
when the number of their solid parts is increased, only
by taking away in great measure those reflections; which
filling the pores with a substance of near the same density
with the parts of the body will do. Besides as filling
the pores of a dark body makes it transparent; so on the
other hand evacuating the pores of a body transparent, or
separating the parts of such a body, renders it opake. As
salts or wet paper by being dried, glass by being reduced to
powder or the surface made rough; and it is well known that
glass vessels discover cracks in them by their opacity. Just
so water itself becomes impervious to the light by being
formed into many small bubbles, whether in froth, or by
being mixed and agitated with any quantity of a liquor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
with which it will not incorporate, such as oyl of turpentine,
or oyl olive.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">A certain</span> electrical experiment made by Mr. <span class="smcap">Hauksbee</span>
may not perhaps be useless to clear up the present speculation,
by shewing that something more is necessary besides
mere porosity for transmitting freely other fine substances.
The experiment is this; that a glass cane rubbed
till it put forth its electric quality would agitate leaf brass
inclosed under a glass vessel, though not at so great a distance,
as if no body had intervened; yet the same cane
would lose all its influence on the leaf brass by the interposition
of a piece of the finest muslin, whose pores are
immensely larger and more patent than those of glass.</p>

<p><a name="c344" id="c344">8.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> I have endeavoured to smooth my way, as much
as I could, to the unfolding yet greater secrets in nature;
for I shall now proceed to shew the reason why bodies appear
of different colours. My reader no doubt will be
sufficiently surprized, when I inform him that the knowledge
of this is deduced from that ludicrous experiment, with
which children divert themselves in blowing bubbles of water
made tenacious by the solution of soap.  And that these
bubbles, as they gradually grow thinner and thinner till
they break, change successively their colours from the same
principle, as all natural bodies preserve theirs.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> author after preparing water with soap, so as to
render it very tenacious, blew it up into a bubble, and placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
it under a glass, that it might not be irregularly agitated
by the air, observed as the water by subsiding changed the
thickness of the bubble, making it gradually less and less till
the bubble broke; there successively appeared colours at the
top of the bubble, which spread themselves into rings surrounding
the top and descending more and more, till they vanished
at the bottom in the same order in which they appeared<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.
The colours emerged in this order: first red, then blue; to which
succeeded red a second time, and blue immediately followed;
after that red a third time, succeeded by blue; to which
followed a fourth red, but succeeded by green; after this a
more numerous order of colours, first red, then yellow,
next green, and after that blue, and at last purple; then
again red, yellow, green, blue, violet followed each other
in order; and in the last place red, yellow, white, blue;
to which succeeded a dark spot, which reflected scarce any
light, though our author found it did make some very obscure
reflection, for the image of the sun or a candle might
be faintly discerned upon it; and this last spot spread itself
more and more, till the bubble at last broke. These colours
were not simple and uncompounded colours, like those
which are exhibited by the prism, when due care is taken
to separate them; but were made by a various mixture of
those simple colours, as will be shewn in the next chapter:
whence these colours, to which I have given the name of
blue, green, or red, were not all alike, but differed as follows.
The blue, which appeared next the dark spot, was a
pure colour, but very faint, resembling the sky-colour; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
white next to it a very strong and intense white, brighter
much than the white, which the bubble reflected, before
any of the colours appeared. The yellow which preceded
this was at first pretty good, but soon grew dilute; and
the red which went before the yellow at first gave a tincture
of scarlet inclining to violet, but soon changed into
a brighter colour; the violet of the next series was deep
with little or no redness in it; the blue a brisk colour, but
came much short of the blue in the next order; the green
was but dilute and pale; the yellow and red were very
bright and full, the best of all the yellows which appeared
among any of the colours: in the preceding orders the purple
was reddish, but the blue, as was just now said, the brightest
of all; the green pretty lively better than in the order
which appeared before it, though that was a good willow
green; the yellow but small in quantity, though bright; the
red of this order not very pure: those which appeared before
yet more obscure, being very dilute and dirty; as were
likewise the three first blues.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Now</span> it is evident, that these colours arose at the
top of the bubble, as it grew by degrees thinner and thinner:
but what the express thickness of the bubble was, where
each of these colours appeared upon it, could not be determined
by these experiments; but was found by another
means, viz. by taking the object glass of a long telescope,
which is in a small degree convex, and placing it upon a
flat glass, so as to touch it in one point, and then water being
put between them, the same colours appeared as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
bubble, in the form of circles or rings surrounding the
point where the glasses touched, which appeared black for
want of any reflection from it, like the top of the bubble
when thinnest<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>: next to this spot lay a blue circle, and
next without that a white one; and so on in the same order
as before, reckoning from the dark spot. And henceforward
I shall speak of each colour, as being of the first, second,
or any following order, as it is the first, second, or any
following one, counting from the black spot in the center
of these rings; which is contrary to the order in which
I must have mentioned them, if I should have reputed
them the first, second, or third, &amp;c. in order, as they arise
after one another upon the top of the bubble.</p>

<p>11. But now by measuring the diameters of each of these
rings, and knowing the convexity of the telescope glass, the
thickness of the water at each of those rings may be determined
with great exactness: for instance the thickness of it,
where the white light of the first order is reflected, is about
3⅞ such parts, of which an inch contains 1000000<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>.
And this measure gives the thickness of the bubble, where
it appeared of this white colour, as well as of the water
between the glasses; though the transparent body which
surrounds the water in these two cases be very different:
for our author found, that the condition of the ambient
body would not alter the species of the colour at all, though
it might its strength and brightness; for pieces of Muscovy
glass, which were so thin as to appear coloured by being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
wet with water, would have their colours faded and made
less bright thereby; but he could not observe their species
at all to be changed. So that the thickness of any transparent
body determines its colour, whatever body the light
passes through in coming to it<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> it was found that different transparent bodies
would not under the same thicknesses exhibit the same colours:
for if the forementioned glasses were laid upon each
other without any water between their surfaces, the air itself
would afford the same colours as the water, but more
expanded, insomuch that each ring had a larger diameter,
and all in the same proportion. So that the thickness of the
air proper to each colour was in the same proportion larger,
than the thickness of the water appropriated to the same<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> we examine with care all the circumstances of these
colours, which will be enumerated in the next chapter,
we shall not be surprized, that our author takes them to
bear a great analogy to the colours of natural bodies<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>. For
the regularity of those various and strange appearances relating
to them, which makes the most mysterious part of the action
between light and bodies, as the next chapter will shew,
is sufficient to convince us that the principle, from which
they flow, is of the greatest importance in the frame of
nature; and therefore without question is designed for no
less a purpose than to give bodies their various colours, to
which end it seems very fitly suited. For if any such transparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
substance of the thickness proper to produce
any one colour should be cut into slender threads,
or broken into fragments, it does not appear but
these should retain the same colour; and a heap of such
fragments should frame a body of that colour. So that this
is without dispute the cause why bodies are of this or the
other colour, that the particles of which they are composed
are of different sizes. Which is farther confirmed by
the analogy between the colours of thin plates, and the colours
of many bodies. For example, these plates do not
look of the same colour when viewed obliquely, as when
seen direct; for if the rings and colours between a convex
and plane glass are viewed first in a direct manner, and then at
different degrees of obliquity, the rings will be observed to dilate
themselves more and more as the obliquity is increased<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>;
which shews that the transparent substance between the glasses
does not exhibit the same colour at the same thickness in all
situations of the eye: just so the colours in the very same
part of a peacock’s tail change, as the tail changes posture
in respect of the sight. Also the colours of silks, cloths,
and other substances, which water or oyl can intimately
penetrate, become faint and dull by the bodies being wet
with such fluids, and recover their brightness again when
dry; just as it was before said that plates of Muscovy glass
grew faint and dim by wetting. To this may be added, that
the colours which painters use will be a little changed by being
ground very elaborately, without question by the diminution
of their parts. All which particulars, and many more that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
might be extracted from our author, give abundant proof of the
present point. I shall only subjoin one more: these transparent
plates transmit through them all the light they do not reflect;
so that when looked through they exhibit those colours,
which result from the depriving white light of the colour reflected.
This may commodiously be tryed by the glasses so
often mentioned; which if looked through exhibit coloured
rings as by reflected light, but in a contrary order; for the middle
spot, which in the other view appears black for want
of reflected light, now looks perfectly white, opposite to
the blue circle; next without this spot the light appears
tinged with a yellowish red; where the white circle appeared
before, it now seems dark; and so of the rest<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>.
Now in the same manner, the light transmitted through foliated
gold into a darkened room appears greenish by the
loss of the yellow light, which gold reflects.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Hence</span> it follows, that the colours of bodies
give a very probable ground for making conjecture concerning
the magnitude of their constituent particles<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>. My reason for
calling it a conjecture is, its being difficult to fix certainly the
order of any colour. The green of vegetables our author
judges to be of the third order, partly because of the intenseness
of their colour; and partly from the changes they
suffer when they wither, turning at first into a greenish or
more perfect yellow, and afterwards some of them to an orange
or red; which changes seem to be effected from their
ringing particles growing denser by the exhalation of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
moisture, and perhaps augmented likewise by the accretion
of the earthy and oily parts of that moisture. How the mentioned
colours should arise from increasing the bulk of those particles,
is evident; seeing those colours lie without the ring of
green between the glasses, and are therefore formed where
the transparent substance which reflects them is thicker. And
that the augmentation of the density of the colorific
particles will conspire to the production of the same effect,
will be evident; if we remember what was said of the different
size of the rings, when air was included between the
glasses, from their size when water was between them;
which shewed that a substance of a greater density than
another gives the same colour at a less thickness. Now
the changes likely to be wrought in the density or magnitude
of the parts of vegetables by withering seem not
greater, than are sufficient to change their colour into those of
the same order; but the yellow and red of the fourth order
are not full enough to agree with those, into which these substances
change, nor is the green of the second sufficiently
good to be the colour of vegetables; so that their colour
must of necessity be of the third order.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> blue colour of syrup of violets our author
supposes to be of the third order; for acids, as vinegar, with
this syrup change it red, and salt of tartar or other alcalies
mixed therewith turn it green. But if the blue colour
of the syrup were of the second order, the red colour,
which acids by attenuating its parts give it, must be of the
first order, and the green given it by alcalies by incrassating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
its particles should be of the second; whereas neither of those
colours is perfect enough, especially the green, to answer
those produced by these changes; but the red may well enough
be allowed to be of the second order, and the green
of the third; in which case the blue must be likewise of
the third order.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> azure colour of the skies our author takes to
be of the first order, which requires the smallest particles
of any colour, and therefore most like to be exhibited by
vapours, before they have sufficiently coalesced to produce
clouds of other colours.</p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> most intense and luminous white is of the
first order, if less strong it is a mixture of the colours of
all the orders. Of the latter sort he takes the colour of linnen,
paper, and such like substances to be; but white metals
to be of the former sort. The arguments for it are
these. The opacity of all bodies has been shewn to arise
from the number and strength of the reflections made within
them; but all experiments shew, that the strongest reflection
is made at those surfaces, which intercede transparent
bodies differing most in density. Among other instances
of this, the experiments before us afford one; for
when air only is included between the glasses, the coloured
rings are not only more dilated, as has before been said,
than when water is between them; but are likewise much
more luminous and bright. It follows therefore, that whatever
medium pervades the pores of bodies, if so be there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
is any, those substances must be most opake, the density of
whose parts differs most from the density of the medium,
which fills their pores. But it has been sufficiently proved in
the former part of this tract, that there is no very dense
medium lodging in, at least pervading at liberty the pores
of bodies. And it is farther proved by the present experiments.
For when air is inclosed by the denser substance
of glass, the rings dilate themselves, as has been said, by being
viewed obliquely; this they do so very much, that at
different obliquities the same thickness of air will exhibit all
sorts of colours. The bubble of water, though surrounded
with the thinner substance of air, does likewise change its
colour by being viewed obliquely; but not any thing near
so much, as in the other case; for in that the same colour
might be seen, when the rings were viewed most obliquely,
at more than twelve times the thickness it appeared at under
a direct view; whereas in this other case the thickness
was never found considerably above half as much again.
Now the colours of bodies not depending only on the light,
that is incident upon them perpendicularly, but likewise
upon that, which falls on them in all degrees of obliquity;
if the medium surrounding their particles were denser than
those particles, all sorts of colours must of necessity be reflected
from them so copiously, as would make the colours of all bodies
white, or grey, or at best very dilute and imperfect. But on the
other hand, if the medium in the pores of bodies be much rarer
than their particles, the colour reflected will be so little
changed by the obliquity of the rays, that the colour produced
by the rays, which fall near the perpendicular, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
so much abound in the reflected light, as to give the body
their colour with little allay. To this may be added, that
when the difference of the contiguous transparent substances
is the same, a colour reflected from the denser substance
reduced into a thin plate and surrounded by the rarer will
be more brisk, than the same colour will be, when reflected
from a thin plate formed of the rarer substance, and surrounded
by the denser; as our author experienced by
blowing glass very thin at a lamp furnace, which exhibited
in the open air more vivid colours, than the air does between
two glasses. From these considerations it is manifest,
that if all other circumstances are alike, the densest bodies
will be most opake. But it was observed before, that these
white metals can hardly be made so thin, except by being
dissolved in corroding liquors, as to be rendred transparent;
though none of them are so dense as gold, which proves
their great opacity to have some other cause besides their
density; and none is more fit to produce this, than such a
size of their particles, as qualifies them to reflect the white
of the first order.</p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap gesperrt">For</span> producing black the particles ought to be
smaller than for exhibiting any of the colours, viz. of a
size answering to the thickness of the bubble, where by reflecting
little or no light it appears colourless; but
yet they must not be too small, for that will make them
transparent through deficiency of reflections in the inward
parts of the body, sufficient to stop the light from going
through it; but they must be of a size bordering upon that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
disposed to reflect the faint blue of the first order, which
affords an evident reason why blacks usually partake a little
of that colour. We see too, why bodies dissolved by fire
or putrefaction turn black: and why in grinding glasses upon
copper plates the dust of the glass, copper, and sand
it is ground with, become very black: and in the last place
why these black substances communicate so easily to others
their hue; which is, that their particles by reason of the
great minuteness of them easily overspread the grosser particles
of others.</p>

<p><a name="c355" id="c355">19.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> now finish this chapter with one remark
of the exceeding great porosity in bodies necessarily required
in all that has here been said; which, when duly considered,
must appear very surprizing; but perhaps it will be matter
of greater surprize, when I affirm that the sagacity of our
author has discovered a method, by which bodies may easily
become so; nay how any the least portion of matter may
be wrought into a body of any assigned dimensions how
great so ever, and yet the pores of that body none of
them greater, than any the smallest magnitude proposed at
pleasure; notwithstanding which the parts of the body shall
so touch, that the body itself shall be hard and solid<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>. The
manner is this: suppose the body be compounded of particles of
such figures, that when laid together the pores found between
them may be equal in bigness to the particles; how
this may be effected, and yet the body be hard and solid,
is not difficult to understand; and the pores of such a body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
may be made of any proposed degree of smallness. But
the solid matter of a body so framed will take up only half
the space occupied by the body; and if each constituent
particle be composed of other less particles according to
the same rule, the solid parts of such a body will be but a
fourth part of its bulk; if every one of these lesser particles
again be compounded in the same manner, the solid
parts of the whole body shall be but one eighth of its bulk;
and thus by continuing the composition the solid parts of
the body may be made to bear as small a proportion to the
whole magnitude of the body, as shall be desired, notwithstanding
the body will be by the contiguity of its parts capable
of being in any degree hard. Which shews that this
whole globe of earth, nay all the known bodies in the universe
together, as far as we know, may be compounded
of no greater a portion of solid matter, than might be reduced
into a globe of one inch only in diameter, or even
less. We see therefore how by this means bodies may easily
be made rare enough to transmit light, with all that
freedom pellucid bodies are found to do.  Though what
is the real structure of bodies we yet know not.</p>

of the sun’s light are manifested by the prism, from the rays
undergoing different degrees of refraction; that the violet-making
rays, which go to the upper part of the coloured
image in the first experiment of the first chapter, are the
most refracted; that the indigo-making rays are refracted,
or turned out of their course by passing through the prism,
something less than the violet-making rays, but more than
the blue-making rays; and the blue-making rays more than
the green; the green-making rays more than the yellow;
the yellow more than the orange; and the orange-making
rays more than the red-making, which are least of all refracted.
The first proof of this, that rays of different colours
are refracted unequally is this. If you take any body,
and paint one half of it red and the other half blue, then
upon viewing it through a prism those two parts shall appear
separated from each other; which can be caused no
otherwise than by the prism’s refracting the light of one
half more than the light of the other half. But the blue
half will be most refracted; for if the body be seen through
the prism in such a situation, that the body shall appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
lifted upwards by the refraction, as a body within a bason
of water, in the experiment mentioned in the first chapter,
appeared to be lifted up by the refraction of the water, so
as to be seen at a greater distance than when the bason is
empty, then shall the blue part appear higher than the red;
but if the refraction of the prism be the contrary way, the
blue part shall be depressed more than the other. Again,
after laying fine threads of black silk across each of the colours,
and the body well inlightened, if the rays coming
from it be received upon a convex glass, so that it
may by refracting the rays cast the image of the body
upon a piece of white paper held beyond the glass; then
it will be seen that the black threads upon the red part of
the image, and those upon the blue part, do not at the same
time appear distinctly in the image of the body projected
by the glass; but if the paper be held so, that the threads
on the blue part may distinctly appear, the threads cannot
be seen distinct upon the red part; but the paper
must be drawn farther off from the convex glass to make the
threads on this part visible; and when the distance is great enough
for the threads to be seen in this red part, they become
indistinct in the other. Whence it appears that the rays proceeding
from each point of the blue part of the body are
sooner united again by the convex glass than the rays which
come from each point of the red parts<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>. But both these experiments
prove that the blue-making rays, as well in the small
refraction of the convex glass, as in the greater refraction
of the prism, are more bent, than the red-making rays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> seems already to explain the reason of the coloured
spectrum made by refracting the sun’s light with a prism,
though our author proceeds to examine that in particular,
and proves that the different coloured rays in that spectrum
are in different degrees refracted; by shewing how to place
the prism in such a posture, that if all the rays were refracted
in the same manner, the spectrum should of necessity
be round: whereas in that case if the angle made by
the two surfaces of the prism, through which the light
passes, that is the angle D&nbsp;F&nbsp;E in fig. 126, be about 63 or 64
degrees, the image instead of being round shall be near
five times as long as broad; a difference enough to shew
a great inequality in the refractions of the rays, which go to
the opposite extremities of the image. To leave no scruple
unremoved, our author is very particular in shewing by a
great number of experiments, that this inequality of refraction
is not casual, and that it does not depend upon any irregularities
of the glass; no nor that the rays are in their
passage through the prism each split and divided; but on
the contrary that every ray of the sun has its own peculiar
degree of refraction proper to it, according to which it is
more or less refracted in passing through pellucid substances
always in the same manner<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>. That the rays are not split
and multiplied by the refraction of the prism, the third of
the experiments related in our first chapter shews very clearly;
for if they were, and the length of the spectrum in
the first refraction were thereby occasioned, the breadth
should be no less dilated by the cross refraction of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
prism; whereas the breadth is not at all increased,
but the image is only thrown into an oblique posture by the
upper part of the rays which were at first more refracted
than the under part, being again turned farthest out of their
course. But the experiment most expressly adapted to prove
this regular diversity of refraction is this, which follows<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.
Two boards A&nbsp;B, C&nbsp;D (in fig. 130.) being erected in a darkened
room at a proper distance, one of them A&nbsp;B being
near the window-shutter E&nbsp;F, a space only being left for
the prism G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I to be placed between them; so that the
rays entring at the hole M of the window-shutter may after
passing through the prism be trajected through a smaller
hole K made in the board A&nbsp;B, and passing on from thence
go out at another hole L made in the board C&nbsp;D of
the same size as the hole K, and small enough to transmit
the rays of one colour only at a time; let another prism
N&nbsp;O&nbsp;P be placed after the board C&nbsp;D to receive the rays passing
through the holes K and L, and after refraction by that
prism let those rays fall upon the white surface Q&nbsp;R. Suppose
first the violet light to pass through the holes, and to
be refracted by the prism N&nbsp;O&nbsp;P to <i>s</i>, which if the prism
N&nbsp;O&nbsp;P were removed should have passed right onto W. If the
prism G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I be turned slowly about, while the boards and
prism N&nbsp;O&nbsp;P remain fixed, in a little time another colour
will fall upon the hole L, which, if the prism N&nbsp;O&nbsp;P were
taken away, would proceed like the former rays to the same
point W; but the refraction of the prism N&nbsp;O&nbsp;P shall not carry
these rays to <i>s</i>, but to some place less distant from W as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
to <i>t</i>. Suppose now the rays which go to <i>t</i> to be the indigo-making
rays. It is manifest that the boards A&nbsp;B, C&nbsp;D, and
prism N&nbsp;O&nbsp;P remaining immoveable, both the violet-making
and indigo-making rays are incident alike upon the prism
N&nbsp;O&nbsp;P, for they are equally inclined to its surface O&nbsp;P, and enter it
in the same part of that surface; which shews that the indigo-making
rays are less diverted out of their course by the refraction
of the prism, than the violet-making rays under an
exact parity of all circumstances. Farther, if the prism G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I
be more turned about, ’till the blue-making rays pass
through the hole L, these shall fall upon the surface Q&nbsp;R
below I, as at <i>v</i>, and therefore are subjected to a less refraction
than the indigo-making rays. And thus by proceeding
it will be found that the green-making rays are
less refracted than the blue-making rays, and so of the rest,
according to the order in which they lie in the coloured
spectrum.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> disposition of the different coloured rays to
be refracted some more than others our author calls their
respective degrees of refrangibility. And since this difference
of refrangibility discovers it self to be so regular, the
next step is to find the rule it observes.</p>

<p><a name="c361" id="c361">5.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is a common principle in optics, that the sine of
the angle of incidence bears to the sine of the refracted angle
a given proportion. If A&nbsp;B (in fig. 131, 132) represent
the surface of any refracting substance, suppose of
water or glass, and C&nbsp;D a ray of light incident upon that face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
in the point D, let D&nbsp;E be the ray, after it has passed the
surface A&nbsp;B; if the ray pass out of the air into the substance
whose surface is A&nbsp;B (as in fig. 131) it shall be turned
from the surface, and if it pass out of that substance into
air it shall be bent towards it (as in fig. 132) But if
F&nbsp;G be drawn through the point D perpendicular to the
surface A&nbsp;B, the angle under C&nbsp;D&nbsp;F made by the incident
ray and this perpendicular is called the angle of incidence;
and the angle under E&nbsp;D&nbsp;G, made by this perpendicular and the
ray after refraction, is called the refracted angle. And if
the circle H&nbsp;F&nbsp;I&nbsp;G be described with any interval cutting C&nbsp;D
in H and D&nbsp;E in I, then the perpendiculars H&nbsp;K, I&nbsp;L being
let fall upon F&nbsp;G, H&nbsp;K is called the sine of the angle
under C&nbsp;D&nbsp;F the angle of incidence, and I&nbsp;L the sine of
the angle under E&nbsp;D&nbsp;G the refracted angle. The first of
these sines is called the sine of the angle of incidence, or
more briefly the sine of incidence, the latter is the sine
of the refracted angle, or the sine of refraction. And it
has been found by numerous experiments that whatever
proportion the sine of incidence H&nbsp;K bears to the sine of
refraction I&nbsp;L in any one case, the same proportion shall
hold in all cases; that is, the proportion between these sines
will remain unalterably the same in the same refracting substance,
whatever be the magnitude of the angle under C&nbsp;D&nbsp;F.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> now because optical writers did not observe that
every beam of white light was divided by refraction, as has
been here explained, this rule collected by them can only
be understood in the gross of the whole beam after refraction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
and not so much of any particular part of it, or
at most only of the middle part of the beam. It therefore
was incumbent upon our author to find by what law the
rays were parted from each other; whether each ray apart
obtained this property, and that the separation was made
by the proportion between the sines of incidence and refraction
being in each species of rays different; or whether
the light was divided by some other rule. But he
proves by a certain experiment that each ray has its sine of
incidence proportional to its sine of refraction; and farther
shews by mathematical reasoning, that it must be so upon
condition only that bodies refract the light by acting
upon it, in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the
refracting body, and upon the same sort of rays always in
an equal degree at the same distances<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> great author teaches in the next place how from
the refraction of the most refrangible and least refrangible rays
to find the refraction of all the intermediate ones<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>. The
method is this: if the sine of incidence be to the sine of refraction
in the least refrangible rays as A to B&nbsp;C, (in fig. 133) and
to the sine of refraction in the most refrangible as A to B&nbsp;D;
if C&nbsp;E be taken equal to C&nbsp;D, and then E&nbsp;D be so divided
in F, G, H, I, K, L, that E&nbsp;D, E&nbsp;F, E&nbsp;G, E&nbsp;H, E&nbsp;I, E&nbsp;K, E&nbsp;L,
E&nbsp;C, shall be proportional to the eight lengths of musical
chords, which found the notes in an octave, E&nbsp;D being
the length of the key, E&nbsp;F the length of the tone above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
that key, E&nbsp;G the length of the lesser third, E&nbsp;H of the
fourth, E&nbsp;I of the fifth, E&nbsp;K of the greater sixth, E&nbsp;L of
the seventh, and E&nbsp;C of the octave above that key; that is if
the lines E&nbsp;D, E&nbsp;F, E&nbsp;G, E&nbsp;H, E&nbsp;I, E&nbsp;K, E&nbsp;L, and E&nbsp;C bear the same
proportion as the numbers, 1, 9/8, 5/6, ¾, ⅓, ¾, 9/61, ½, respectively
then shall B&nbsp;D, B&nbsp;F, be the two limits of the sines of refraction of
the violet-making rays, that is the violet-making rays shall
not all of them have precisely the same sine of refraction,
but none of them shall have a greater sine than B&nbsp;D, nor
a less than B&nbsp;F, though there are violet-making rays which
answer to any sine of refraction that can be taken between
these two. In the same manner B&nbsp;F and B&nbsp;G
are the limits of the sines of refraction of the indigo-making
rays; B&nbsp;G, B&nbsp;H are the limits belonging to the blue-making
rays; B&nbsp;H, B&nbsp;I the limits pertaining to the green-making
rays, B&nbsp;I, B&nbsp;K the limits for the yellow-making rays;
B&nbsp;K, B&nbsp;L the limits for the orange-making rays; and lastly,
B&nbsp;L and B&nbsp;C the extreme limits of the sines of refraction
belonging to the red-making rays. These are the proportions
by which the heterogeneous rays of light are separated
from each other in refraction.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap gesperrt">When</span> light passes out of glass into air, our author
found A to B&nbsp;C as 50 to 77, and the same A to B&nbsp;D as 50
to 78. And when it goes out of any other refracting substance
into air, the excess of the sine of refraction of any
one species of rays above its sine of incidence bears a constant
proportion, which holds the same in each species, to
the excess of the sine of refraction of the same sort of rays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
above the sine of incidence into the air out of glass; provided
the sines of incidence both in glass and the other substance
are equal. This our author verified by transmitting the
light through prisms of glass included within a prismatic
vessel of water; and draws from those experiments the following
observations: that whenever the light in passing
through so many surfaces parting diverse transparent substances
is by contrary refractions made to emerge into the
air in a direction parallel to that of its incidence, it will
appear afterwards white at any distance from the prisms,
where you shall please to examine it; but if the direction
of its emergence be oblique to its incidence, in receding
from the place of emergence its edges shall appear tinged
with colours: which proves that in the first case there is
no inequality in the refractions of each species of rays, but
that when any one species is so refracted as to emerge parallel
to the incident rays, every sort of rays after refraction
shall likewise be parallel to the same incident rays, and
to each other; whereas on the contrary, if the rays of
any one sort are oblique to the incident light, the several
species shall be oblique to each other, and be gradually
separated by that obliquity. From hence he deduces
both the forementioned theorem, and also this other;
that in each sort of rays the proportion of the sine of incidence
to the sine of refraction, in the passage of the ray
out of any refracting substance into another, is compounded
of the proportion to which the sine of incidence would have to
the sine of refraction in the passage of that ray out of the
first substance into any third, and of the proportion which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
the sine of incidence would have to the sine of refraction
in the passage of the ray out of that third substance into
the second. From so simple and plain an experiment has
our most judicious author deduced these important theorems,
by which we may learn how very exact and circumspect
he has been in this whole work of his optics; that
notwithstanding his great particularity in explaining his
doctrine, and the numerous collection of experiments he
has made to clear up every doubt which could arise, yet
at the same time he has used the greatest caution to make
out every thing by the simplest and easiest means possible.</p>

<p><a name="c366" id="c366">9.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> author adds but one remark more upon refraction,
which is, that if refraction be performed in the manner
he has supposed from the light’s being pressed by the
refracting power perpendicularly toward the surface of the
refracting body, and consequently be made to move swifter
in the body than before its incidence; whether this power
act equally at all distances or otherwise, provided only its
power in the same body at the same distances remain without
variation the same in one inclination of the incident
rays as well as another; he observes that the refracting powers
in different bodies will be in the duplicate proportion
of the tangents of the lead angles, which the refracted light
can make with the surfaces of the refracting bodies<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>. This
observation may be explained thus. When the light passes
into any refracting substance, it has been shewn above that
the sine of incidence bears a constant proportion to the sine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of refraction. Suppose the light to pass to the refracting
body A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D (in fig. 134) in the line E&nbsp;F, and to fall upon it at the
point F, and then to proceed within the body in the line
F&nbsp;G. Let H&nbsp;I be drawn through F perpendicular to the surface
A&nbsp;B, and any circle K&nbsp;L&nbsp;M&nbsp;N be described to the center
F. Then from the points O and P where this circle cuts
the incident and refracted ray, the perpendiculars O&nbsp;Q, P&nbsp;R
being drawn, the proportion of O&nbsp;Q to P&nbsp;R will remain
the same in all the different obliquities, in which the same ray
of light can fall on the surface A&nbsp;B. Now O&nbsp;Q is less than
F&nbsp;L the semidiameter of the circle K&nbsp;L&nbsp;M&nbsp;N, but the more
the ray E&nbsp;F is inclined down toward the surface A&nbsp;B, the
greater will O&nbsp;Q be, and will approach nearer to the magnitude
of F&nbsp;L. But the proportion of O&nbsp;Q to P&nbsp;R remaining
always the same, when O&nbsp;Q, is largest, P&nbsp;R will also be
greatest; so that the more the incident ray E&nbsp;F is inclined
toward the surface A&nbsp;B, the more the ray F&nbsp;G after refraction
will be inclined toward the same. Now if the line
F&nbsp;S&nbsp;T be so drawn, that S&nbsp;V being perpendicular to F&nbsp;I shall
be to F&nbsp;L the semidiameter of the circle in the constant proportion
of P&nbsp;R to O&nbsp;Q; then the angle under N&nbsp;F&nbsp;T is that
which I meant by the least of all that can be made by the
refracted ray with this surface, for the ray after refraction
would proceed in this line, if it were to come to the point
F lying on the very surface A&nbsp;B; for if the incident ray
came to the point F in any line between A&nbsp;F and F&nbsp;H, the
ray after refraction would proceed forward in some line
between F&nbsp;T and F&nbsp;I. Here if N&nbsp;W be drawn perpendicular
to F&nbsp;N, this line N&nbsp;W in the circle K&nbsp;L&nbsp;M&nbsp;N is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
the tangent of the angle under N&nbsp;F&nbsp;S. Thus much being premised,
the sense of the forementioned proposition is this. Let there
be two refracting substances (in fig. 135) A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D, and E&nbsp;F&nbsp;G&nbsp;H.
Take a point, as I, in the surface A&nbsp;B, and to the center I
with any semidiameter describe the circle K&nbsp;L&nbsp;M. In like
manner on the surface E&nbsp;F take some point N, as a center,
and describe with the same semidiameter the circle O&nbsp;P&nbsp;Q.
Let the angle under B&nbsp;I&nbsp;R be the least which the refracted
light can make with the surface A&nbsp;B, and the angle under
F&nbsp;N&nbsp;S the least which the refracted light can make with
the surface E&nbsp;F. Then if L&nbsp;T be drawn perpendicular to
A&nbsp;B, and P&nbsp;V perpendicular to E&nbsp;F; the whole power, wherewith
the substance A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D acts on the light, will bear to
the whole power wherewith the substance E&nbsp;F&nbsp;G&nbsp;H acts on,
the light, a proportion, which is duplicate of the proportion,
which L&nbsp;T bears to P&nbsp;V.</p>

<p><a name="c368" id="c368">10.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Upon</span> comparing according to this rule the refractive
powers of a great many bodies it is found, that unctuous
bodies which abound most with sulphureous parts
refract the light two or three times more in proportion to
their density than others: but that those bodies, which seem
to receive in their composition like proportions of sulphureous
parts, have their refractive powers proportional to their
densities; as appears beyond contradiction by comparing
the refractive power of so rare a substance as the air with
that of common glass or rock crystal, though these substances
are 2000 times denser than air; nay the same proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
is found to hold without sensible difference in comparing
air with pseudo-topar and glass of antimony, though
the pseudo-topar be 3500 times denser than air, and glass
of antimony no less than 4400 times denser. This power
in other substances, as salts, common water, spirit of
wine, &amp;c. seems to bear a greater proportion to their densities
than these last named, according as they abound with
sulphurs more than these; which makes our author conclude
it probable, that bodies act upon the light chiefly, if not
altogether, by means of the sulphurs in them; which kind
of substances it is likely enters in some degree the composition
of all bodies. Of all the substances examined by
our author, none has so great a refractive power, in respect
of its density, as a diamond.</p>

<p><a name="c369" id="c369">11.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> author finishes these remarks, and all he offers
relating to refraction, with observing, that the action between
light and bodies is mutual, since sulphureous bodies,
which are most readily set on fire by the sun’s light, when
collected upon them with a burning glass, act more upon
light in refracting it, than other bodies of the same density
do. And farther, that the densest bodies, which have
been now shewn to act most upon light, contract the greatest
heat by being exposed to the summer sun.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Having</span> thus dispatched what relates to refraction,
we must address ourselves to discourse of the other operation
of bodies upon light in reflecting it. When light
passes through a surface, which divides two transparent bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
differing in density, part of it only is transmitted,
another part being reflected.  And if the light pass out of
the denser body into the rarer, by being much inclined to
the foresaid surface at length no part of it shall pass through,
but be totally reflected. Now that part of the light, which
suffers the greatest refraction, shall be wholly reflected with
a less obliquity of the rays, than the parts of the light
which undergo a less degree of refraction; as is evident
from the last experiment recited in the first chapter; where,
as the prisms D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F, G&nbsp;H&nbsp;I, (in fig. 129.) were turned about,
the violet light was first totally reflected, and then
the blue, next to that the green, and so of the rest. In consequence
of which our author lays down this proportion; that
the sun’s light differs in reflexibility, those rays being most reflexible,
which are most refrangible. And collects from this,
in conjunction with other arguments, that the refraction
and reflection, of light are produced by the same cause,
compassing those different effects only by the difference of
circumstances with which it is attended. Another proof
of this being taken by our author from what he has discovered
of the passage of light through thin transparent
plates, viz. that any particular species of light, suppose,
for instance, the red-making rays, will enter and pass out
of such a plate, if that plate be of some certain thicknesses;
but if it be of other thicknesses, it will not break through
it, but be reflected back: in which is seen, that the thickness
of the plate determines whether the power, by which
that plate acts upon the light, shall reflect it, or suffer it to
pass through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> this last mentioned surprising property of the
action between light and bodies affords the reason of all
that has been said in the preceding chapter concerning the
colours of natural bodies; and must therefore more particularly
be illustrated and explained, as being what will
principally unfold the nature of the action of bodies upon
light.</p>

<p><a name="c371" id="c371">14.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">To</span> begin: The object glass of a long telescope being
laid upon a plane glass, as proposed in the foregoing chapter,
in open day-light there will be exhibited rings of various
colours, as was there related; but if in a darkened
room the coloured spectrum be formed by the prism, as in
the first experiment of the first chapter, and the glasses be
illuminated by a reflection from the spectrum, the rings
shall not in this case exhibit the diversity of colours before
described, but appear all of the colour of the light
which falls upon the glasses, having dark rings between.
Which shews that the thin plate of air between the
glasses at some thicknesses reflects the incident light, at
other places does not reflect it, but is found in those places
to give the light passage; for by holding the glasses in
the light as it passes from the prism to the spectrum, suppose
at such a distance from the prism that the several sorts
of light must be sufficiently separated from each other, when
any particular sort of light falls on the glasses, you will find
by holding a piece of white paper at a small distance beyond
the glasses, that at those intervals, where the dark
lines appeared upon the glasses, the light is so transmitted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
as to paint upon the paper rings of light having that colour
which falls upon the glasses. This experiment therefore
opens to us this very strange property of reflection,
that in these thin plates it should bear such a relation to the
thickness of the plate, as is here shewn. Farther, by carefully
measuring the diameters of each ring it is found, that
whereas the glasses touch where the dark spot appears in
the center of the rings made by reflexion, where the air
is of twice the thickness at which the light of the first ring
is reflected, there the light by being again transmitted makes
the first dark ring; where the plate has three times
that thickness which exhibits the first lucid ring, it again
reflects the light forming the second lucid ring; when
the thickness is four times the first, the light is again transmitted
so as to make the second dark ring; where the air
is five times the first thickness, the third lucid ring is made;
where it has six times the thickness, the third dark ring appears,
and so on: in so much that the thicknesses, at which
the light is reflected, are in proportion to the numbers 1, 3,
5, 7, 9, &amp;c. and the thicknesses, where the light is transmitted,
are in the proportion of the numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,
&amp;c. And these proportions between the thicknesses which
reflect and transmit the light remain the same in all situations
of the eye, as well when the rings are viewed obliquely,
as when looked on perpendicularly. We must farther here
observe, that the light, when it is reflected, as well as when it is
transmitted, enters the thin plate, and is reflected from its farther
surface; because, as was before remarked, the altering
the transparent body behind the farther surface alters the degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
of reflection as when a thin piece of Muscovy glass
has its farther surface wet with water, and the colour of
the glass made dimmer by being so wet; which shews that
the light reaches to the water, otherwise its reflection could
not be influenced by it. But yet this reflection depends
upon some power propagated from the first surface to the
second; for though made at the second surface it depends
also upon the first, because it depends upon the distance
between the surfaces; and besides, the body through
which the light passes to the first surface influences the reflection:
for in a plate of Muscovy glass, wetting the surface,
which first receives the light, diminishes the reflection,
though not quite so much as wetting the farther surface will
do. Since therefore the light in passing through these thin
plates at some thicknesses is reflected, but at others transmitted
without reflection, it is evident, that this reflection is
caused by some power propagated from the first surface,
which intermits and returns successively. Thus is every ray
apart disposed to alternate reflections and transmissions at
equal intervals; the successive returns of which disposition
our author calls the fits of easy reflection, and of easy transmission.
But these fits, which observe the same law of
returning at equal intervals, whether the plates are viewed
perpendicularly or obliquely, in different situations of the
eye change their magnitude. For what was observed before
in respect of those rings, which appear in open day-light,
holds likewise in these rings exhibited by simple lights; namely,
that these two alter in bigness according to the different
angle under which they are seen: and our author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
lays down a rule whereby to determine the thicknesses of
the plate of air, which shall exhibit the same colour under
different oblique views<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>. And the thickness of the aereal
plate, which in different inclinations of the rays will exhibit
to the eye in open day-light the same colour, is also varied
by the same rule<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>.  He contrived farther a method
of comparing in the bubble of water the proportion between
the thickness of its coat, which exhibited any colour
when seen perpendicularly, to the thickness of it, where the
same colour appeared by an oblique view; and he found
the same rule to obtain here likewise<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>. But farther, if the
glasses be enlightened successively by all the several species
of light, the rings will appear of different magnitudes; in
the red light they will be larger than in the orange colour,
in that larger than in the yellow, in the yellow larger than
in the green, less in the blue, less yet in the indigo, and
least of all in the violet: which shew that the same thickness
of the aereal plate is not fitted to reflect all colours, but
that one colour is reflected where another would have been
transmitted; and as the rays which are most strongly refracted
form the least rings, a rule is laid down by our author
for determining the relation, which the degree of refraction
of each species of colour has to the thicknesses of
the plate where it is reflected.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap gesperrt">From</span> these observations our author shews the reason
of that great variety of colours, which appears in these thin
plates in the open white light of the day. For when this white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
light falls on the plate, each part of the light forms rings of
its own colour; and the rings of the different colours not
being of the same bigness are variously intermixed, and form
a great variety of tints<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c375a" id="c375a">16.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> certain experiments, which our author made with
thick glasses, he found, that these fits of easy reflection and
transmission returned for some thousands of times, and thereby
farther confirmed his reasoning concerning them<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c375b" id="c375b">17.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Upon</span> the whole, our great author concludes from
some of the experiments made by him, that the reason why all
transparent bodies refract part of the light incident upon them,
and reflect another part, is, because some of the light, when it
comes to the surface of the body, is in a fit of easy transmission,
and some part of it in a fit of easy reflection; and from
the durableness of these fits he thinks it probable, that the
light is put into these fits from their first emission out of the
luminous body; and that these fits continue to return at equal
intervals without end, unless those intervals be changed
by the light’s entring into some refracting substance<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>. He
likewise has taught how to determine the change which is
made of the intervals of the fits of easy transmission and reflection,
when the light passes out of one transparent space or
substance into another. His rule is, that when the light passes
perpendicularly to the surface, which parts any two transparent
substances, these intervals in the substance, out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
which the light passes, bear to the intervals in the substance,
whereinto the light enters, the same proportion, as the sine of
incidence bears to the sine of refraction<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>. It is farther to be
observed, that though the fits of easy reflection return at constant
intervals, yet the reflecting power never operates, but at
or near a surface where the light would suffer refraction; and
if the thickness of any transparent body shall be less than the
intervals of the fits, those intervals shall scarce be disturbed by
such a body, but the light shall pass through without any reflection<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="c376" id="c376">18.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">What</span> the power in nature is, whereby this action
between light and bodies is caused, our author has not discovered.
But the effects, which he has discovered, of this
power are very surprising, and altogether wide from any conjectures
that had ever been framed concerning it; and from
these discoveries of his no doubt this power is to be deduced,
if we ever can come to the knowledge of it. Sir&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Isaac
Newton</span> has in general hinted at his opinion concerning it;
that probably it is owing to some very subtle and elastic substance
diffused through the universe, in which such vibrations
may be excited by the rays of light, as they pass through
it, that shall occasion it to operate so differently upon the
light in different places as to give rise to these alternate fits
of reflection and transmission, of which we have now been
speaking<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>. He is of opinion, that such a substance may produce
this and other effects also in nature, though it be so
rare as not to give any sensible resistance to bodies in motion<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>

<p><a name="c377a" id="c377a">19.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> order for the more full discovery of this action between
light and bodies, our author began another set of experiments,
wherein he found the light to be acted on as it passes
near the edges of solid bodies; in particular all small bodies,
such as the hairs of a man’s head or the like, held in a
very small beam of the sun’s light, cast extremely broad shadows.
And in one of these experiments the shadow was
35 times the breadth of the body<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>. These shadows are also

Of OPTIC GLASSES.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap08">SIR <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> having deduced from his doctrine
of light and colours a surprising improvement of telescopes,
of which I intend here to give an account, I shall
first premise something in general concerning those instruments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="c378" id="c378">2.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> will be understood from what has been said above,
that when light falls upon the surface of glass obliquely, after
its entrance into the glass it is more inclined to the line
drawn through the point of incidence perpendicular to that
surface, than before. Suppose a ray of light issuing from the
point A (in fig. 136) falls on a piece of glass B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E, whose
surface B&nbsp;C, whereon the ray falls, is of a spherical or globular
figure, the center whereof is F. Let the ray proceed in
the line A&nbsp;G falling on the surface B&nbsp;C in the point G, and draw
F&nbsp;G&nbsp;H. Here the ray after its entrance into the glass will
pass on in some line, as G&nbsp;I, more inclined toward the line F&nbsp;G&nbsp;H
that the line A&nbsp;G is inclined thereto; for the line F&nbsp;G&nbsp;H is perpendicular
to the surface B&nbsp;C in the point G. By this means,
if a number of rays proceeding from any one point
fall on a convex spherical surface of glass, they shall be
inflected (as is represented in fig. 137,) so as to be gathered
pretty close together about the line drawn through the center
of the glass from the point, whence the rays proceed; which
line henceforward we shall call the axis of the glass: or the
point from whence the rays proceed may be so near the glass,
that the rays shall after entring the glass still go on to spread
themselves, but not so much as before; so that if the rays
were to be continued backward (as in fig. 138,) they should
gather together about the axis at a place more remote from
the glass, than the point is, whence they actually proceed. In
these and the following figures A denotes the point to which
the rays are related before refraction, B the point to which they
are directed afterwards, and C the center of the refracting surface.
Here we may observe, that it is possible to form the glass of
such a figure, that all the rays which proceed from one point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
shall after refraction be reduced again exactly into one point on
the axis of the glass. But in glasses of a spherical form though this
does not happen; yet the rays, which fall within a moderate distance
from the axis, will unite extremely near together. If the
light fall on a concave spherical surface, after refraction it shall
spread quicker than before (as in fig. 139,) unless the rays proceed
from a point between the center and the surface of the glass. If
we suppose the rays of light, which fall upon the glass, not to
proceed from any point, but to move so as to tend all to some
point in the axis of the glass beyond the surface; if the glass
have a convex surface, the rays shall unite about the axis
sooner, than otherwise they would do (as in fig. 140,) unless
the point to which they tended was between the surface and
the center of that surface. But if the surface be concave,
they shall not meet so soon: nay perhaps converge. (See
fig. 141 and 142.)</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Farther</span>, because the light in passing out of glass into
the air is turned by the refraction farther off from the
line drawn through the point of incidence perpendicular to
the refracting surface, than it was before; the light which
spreads from a point shall by parting through a convex surface
of glass into the air be made either to spread less than
before (as in fig. 143,) or to gather about the axis beyond
the glass (as in fig. 144.) But if the rays of light were proceeding
to a point in the axis of the glass, they should by
the refraction be made to unite sooner about that axis
(as in fig. 145.) If the surface of the glass be concave, rays which
proceed from a point shall be made to spread faster (as in
fig 146,) but rays which are tending to a point in the axis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
the glass, shall be made to gather about the axis farther from
the glass (as in fig. 147) or even to diverge (as in fig. 148,)
unless the point, to which the rays are directed, lies between
the surface of the glass and its center.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> rays, which spread themselves from a point, are
called diverging; and such as move toward a point, are called
converging rays. And the point in the axis of the glass, about
which the rays gather after refraction, is called the focus of
those rays.</p>

<p><a name="c380" id="c380">5.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> a glass be formed of two convex spherical surfaces
(as in fig. 149,) where the glass AB is formed of the surfaces
A&nbsp;C&nbsp;B and A&nbsp;D&nbsp;B, the line drawn through the centers of the
two surfaces, as the line E&nbsp;F, is called the axis of the glass;
and rays, which diverge from any point of this axis, by the
refraction of the glass will be caused to converge toward some
part of the axis, or at least to diverge as from a point more
remote from the glass, than that from whence they proceeded;
for the two surfaces both conspire to produce this effect
upon the rays. But converging rays will be caused by such a
glass as this to converge sooner. If a glass be formed of two
concave surfaces, as the glass A&nbsp;B (in fig. 150,) the line C&nbsp;D
drawn through the centers, to which the two surfaces are
formed, is called the axis of the glass. Such a glass shall
cause diverging rays, which proceed from any point in the
axis of the glass, to diverge much more, as if they came from
some place in the axis of the glass nearer to it than the point,
whence the rays actually proceed. But converging rays will
be made either to converge less, or even to diverge.</p>

<p><a name="c381" id="c381">6.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> these glasses rays, which proceed from any point
near the axis, will be affected as it were in the same manner,
as if they proceeded from the very axis it self, and such as
converge toward a point at a small distance from the axis will
suffer much the same effects from the glass, as if they converged to
some point in the very axis. By this means any luminous body
exposed to a convex glass may have an image formed upon
any white body held beyond the glass. This may be easily
tried with a common spectacle-glass. For if such a glass
be held between a candle and a piece of white paper, if the
distances of the candle, glass, and paper be properly adjusted,
the image of the candle will appear very distinctly upon the
paper, but be seen inverted; the reason whereof is this.
Let A&nbsp;B (in fig. 151) be the glass, C&nbsp;D an object placed
cross the axis of the glass. Let the rays of light, which issue
from the point E, where the axis of the glass crosses the object,
be so refracted by the glass, as to meet again about the
point F. The rays, which diverge from the point C of the
object, shall meet again almost at the same distance from
the glass, but on the other side of the axis, as at G; for the
rays at the glass cross the axis. In like manner the rays,
which proceed from the point D, will meet about H on the
other side of the axis. None of these rays, neither those
which proceed from the point E in the axis, nor those which
issue from C or D, will meet again exactly in one point; but
yet in one place, as is here supposed at F, G, and H, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
will be crouded so close together, as to make a distinct
image of the object upon any body proper to reflect it,
which shall be held there.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the object be too near the glass for the rays to
converge after the refraction, the rays shall issue out of the
glass, as if they diverged from a point more distant from
the glass, than that from whence they really proceed (as
in fig. 152,) where the rays coming from the point E
of the object, which lies on the axis of the glass A&nbsp;B, issue
out of the glass, as if they came from the point F
more remote from the glass than E; and the rays proceeding
from the point C issue out of the glass, as if they proceeded
from the point G; likewise the rays which issue
from the point D emerge out of the glass, as if they came
from the point H. Here the point G is on the same side
of the axis, as the point C; and the point H on the same
side, as the point D. In this case to an eye placed beyond
the glass the object should appear, as if it were in the situation
G&nbsp;F&nbsp;H.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> the glass A&nbsp;B had been concave (as in, fig. 153,) to
an eye beyond the glass the object C&nbsp;D would appear in
the situation G&nbsp;H, nearer to the glass than really it is. Here
also the object will not be inverted; but the point G is on
the same side the axe with the point C, and H on the
same side as D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Hence</span> may be understood, why spectacles made
with convex glasses help the sight in old age: for the eye
in that age becomes unfit to see objects distinctly, except
such as are remov’d to a very great distance; whence all
men, when they first stand in need of spectacles, are observed
to read at arm’s length, and to hold the object at a
greater distance, than they used to do before. But when an
object is removed at too great a distance from the sight,
it cannot be seen clearly, by reason that a less quantity of
light from the object will enter the eye, and the whole
object will also appear smaller. Now by help of a convex
glass an object may be held near, and yet the rays of
light issuing from it will enter the eye, as if the object
were farther removed.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">After</span> the same manner concave glasses assist such,
as are short sighted. For these require the object to be
brought inconveniently near to the eye, in order to their
seeing it distinctly; but by such a glass the object may be
removed to a proper distance, and yet the rays of light
enter the eye, as if they came from a place much nearer.</p>

<p><a name="c383" id="c383">11.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Whence</span> these defects of the sight arise, that in
old age objects cannot be seen distinct within a moderate
distance, and in short-sightedness not without being brought
too near, will be easily understood, when the manner of
vision in general shall be explain’d; which I shall now endeavour
to do, in order to be better understood in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
follows. The eye is form’d, as is represented in fig. 154.
It is of a globular figure, the fore part whereof scarce
more protuberant than the rest is transparent. Underneath
this transparent part is a small collection of an humour in
appearance like water, and it has also the same refractive
power as common water; this is called the aqueous humour,
and fills the space A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C&nbsp;D in the figure. Next beyond
lies the body D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F&nbsp;G; this is solid but transparent, it is
composed with two convex surfaces, the hinder surface E&nbsp;F&nbsp;G
being more convex, than the anterior E&nbsp;D&nbsp;G. Between the
outer membrane A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C, and this body E&nbsp;D&nbsp;G&nbsp;F is placed that
membrane, which exhibits the colours, that are seen round
the sight of the eye; and the black spot, which is called the
sight or pupil, is a hole in this membrane, through which the
light enters, whereby we see. This membrane is fixed only
by its outward circuit, and has a muscular power, whereby
it dilates the pupil in a weak light, and contracts it in
a strong one. The body D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F&nbsp;G is called the crystalline
humour, and has a greater refracting power than water.
Behind this the bulk of the eye is filled up with what is
called the vitreous humor, this has much the same refractive
power with water. At the bottom of the eye toward
the inner side next the nose the optic glass enters, as at
H, and spreads it self all over the inside of the eye, till
within a small diftance from A and C. Now any object, as
I&nbsp;K, being placed before the eye, the rays of light issuing
from each point of this object are so refracted by the convex
surface of the aqueous humour, as to be caused to converge;
after this being received by the convex surface E&nbsp;D&nbsp;G<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
of the crystalline humour, which has a greater refractive
power than the aqueous, the rays, when they are entered
into this surface, still more converge, and at going out of
the surface E&nbsp;F&nbsp;G into a humour of a less refractive power
than the crystalline they are made to converge yet farther. By
all these successive refractions they are brought to converge at
the bottom of the eye, so that a distinct image of the object
as L&nbsp;M is impress’d on the nerve. And by this means
the object is seen.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> has been made a difficulty, that the image of
the object impressed on the nerve is inverted, so that the
upper part of the image is impressed on the lower part of
the eye. But this difficulty, I think, can no longer remain,
if we only consider, that upper and lower are terms
merely relative to the ordinary position of our bodies:
and our bodies, when view’d by the eye, have their image as
much inverted as other objects; so that the image of our
own bodies, and of other objects, are impressed on the eye
in the same relation to one another, as they really have.</p>

<p><a name="c385" id="c385">12.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> eye can see objects equally distinct at very
different distances, but in one distance only at the same
time.  That the eye may accomodate itself to different
distances, some change in its humours is requir’d.  It is
my opinion, that this change is made in the figure of the
crystalline humour, as I have indeavoured to prove in another
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">If</span> any of the humours of the eye are too flat,
they will refract the light too little; which is the case in
old age. If they are too convex, they refract too much;
as in those who are short-sighted.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> manner of direct vision being thus explained,
I proceed to give some account of telescopes, by which we
view more distinctly remote objects; and also of microscopes,
whereby we magnify the appearance of small objects. In
the first place, the most simple sort of telescope is composed
of two glasses, either both convex, or one convex,
and the other concave. (The first sort of these is represented
in fig. 155, the latter in fig. 156.)</p>

<p><a name="c386" id="c386">15.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> fig. 155 let A&nbsp;B represent the convex glass next
the object, C&nbsp;D the other glass more convex near the eye.
Suppose the object-glass A&nbsp;B to form the image of the object
at E&nbsp;F; so that if a sheet of white paper were to be
held in this place, the object would appear. Now suppose
the rays, which pass the glass A&nbsp;B, and are united about
F, to proceed to the eye glass C&nbsp;D, and be there refracted.
Three only of these rays are drawn in the figure,
those which pass by the extremities of the glass A&nbsp;B, and
that which passes its middle. If the glass C&nbsp;D be
placed at such a distance from the image E&nbsp;F, that the rays,
which pass by the point F, after having proceeded through
the glass diverge so much, as the rays do that come from
an object, which is at such a distance from the eye as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
to be seen distinctly, these being received by the eye will
make on the bottom of the eye a distinct representation of
the point F. In like manner the rays, which pass through
the object glass A&nbsp;B to the point E after proceeding through
the eye-glass C&nbsp;D will on the bottom of the eye make a
distinct representation of the point E.  But if the eye be
placed where these rays, which proceed from E, cross those,
which proceed from F, the eye will receive the distinct impression
of both these points at the same time; and consequently
will also receive a distinct impression from all the
intermediate parts of the image E&nbsp;F, that is, the eye will
see the object, to which the telescope is directed, distinctly.
The place of the eye is about the point G, where the rays
H&nbsp;E, H&nbsp;F cross, which pass through the middle of the object-glass
A&nbsp;B to the points E and F; or at the place where
the focus would be formed by rays coming from the point
H, and refracted by the glass C&nbsp;D.  To judge how much
this instrument magnifies any object, we must first observe,
that the angle under E&nbsp;H&nbsp;F, in which the eye at the point H
would see the image E&nbsp;F, is nearly the same as the angle,
under which the object appears by direct vision; but when
the eye is in G, and views the object through the telescope,
it sees the same under a greater angle; for the rays, which
coming from E and F cross in G, make a greater angle than
the rays, which proceed from the point H to these points E
and F.  The angle at G is greater than that at H in the
proportion, as the distance between the glasses A&nbsp;B and C&nbsp;D
is greater than the distance of the point G from the glass
C&nbsp;D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="c388a" id="c388a">16.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> telescope inverts the object; for the rays, which
came from the right-hand side of the object, go to the
point E the left side of the image; and the rays, which
come from the left side of the object, go to F the right
side of the image. These rays cross again in G, so that
the rays, which come from the right side of the object, go
to the right side of the eye; and the rays from the left
side of the object go to the left side of the eye. Therefore
in this telescope the image in the eye has the same
situation as the object; and seeing that in direct vision
the image in the eye has an inverted situation, here, where
the situation is not inverted, the object must appear so.
This is no inconvenience to astronomers in celestial observations;
but for objects here on the earth it is usual to add
two other convex glasses, which may turn the object again
(as is represented in fig. 157,) or else to use the other kind of
telescope with a concave eye-glass.</p>

<p><a name="c388b" id="c388b">17.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> this other kind of telescope the effect is founded
on the same principles, as in the former. The distinctness
of the appearance is procured in the same manner. But
here the eye-glass C&nbsp;D (in fig. 156) is placed between the
image E&nbsp;F, and the object glass A&nbsp;B. By this means the rays,
which come from the right-hand side of the object, and proceed
toward E the left side of the image, being intercepted
by the eye-glass are carried to the left side of the eye; and
the rays, which come from the left side of the object, go
to the right side of the eye; so that the impression in the
eye being inverted the object appears in the same situation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
as when view’d by the naked eye. The eye must here be
placed close to the glass. The degree of magnifying in
this instrument is thus to be found. Let the rays, which
pass through the glass A&nbsp;B at H, after the refraction of
the eye-glass C&nbsp;D diverge, as if they came from the point
G; then the rays, which come from the extremities of the
object, enter the eye under the angle at G; so that here
also the object will be magnified in the proportion of the
distance between the glasses, to the distance of G from
the eye-glass.</p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> space, that can be taken in at one view in
this telescope, depends on the breadth of the pupil of the
eye; for as the rays, which go to the points E, F of the
image, are something distant from each other, when they
come out of the glass C&nbsp;D, if they are wider asunder
than the pupil, it is evident, that they cannot both enter
the eye at once. In the other telescope the eye is placed
in the point G, where the rays that come from the points
E or F cross each other, and therefore must enter the eye
together. On this account the telescope with convex glasses
takes in a larger view, than those with concave. But in
these also the extent of the view is limited, because the eye-glass
does not by the refraction towards its edges form so
distinct a representation of the object, as near the middle.</p>

<p><a name="c389" id="c389">18.</a><span class="smcap">Microscopes</span> are of two sorts. One kind is only a
very convex glass, by the means of which the object may
be brought very near the eye, and yet be seen distinctly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
This microscope magnifies in proportion, as the object by
being brought near the eye will form a broader impression
on the optic nerve. The other kind made with convex
glasses produces its effects in the same manner as the telescope.
Let the object A&nbsp;B (in fig. 158) be placed under the glass C&nbsp;D,
and by this glass let an image be formed of this object.
Above this image let the glass G&nbsp;H be placed. By this glass
let the rays, which proceed from the points A and B, be
refracted, as is expressed in the figure.  In particular, let
the rays, which from each of these points pass through the
middle of the glass C&nbsp;D, cross in I, and there let the eye
be placed. Here the object will appear larger, when seen
through the microscope, than if that instrument were removed,
in proportion as the angle, in which these rays cross
in I, is greater than the angle, which the lines would make,
that should be drawn from I to A and B; that is, in the
proportion made up of the proportion of the distance of the
object A&nbsp;B from I, to the distance of I from the glass G&nbsp;H;
and of the proportion of the distance between the glasses,
to the distance of the object A&nbsp;B from the glass C&nbsp;D.</p>


<p><a name="c390" id="c390">19.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">I shall</span> now proceed to explain the imperfection in
these instruments, occasioned by the different refrangibility of
the light which comes from every object. This prevents the
image of the object from being formed in the focus of the object
glass with perfect distinctness; so that if the eye-glass magnify
the image overmuch, the imperfections of it must be visible,
and make the whole appear confused. Our author more fully
to satisfy himself, that the different refrangibility of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
several sorts of rays is sufficient to produce this irregularity,
underwent the labour of a very nice and difficult experiment,
whose process he has at large set down, to prove,
that the rays of light are refracted as differently in the small
refraction of telescope glasses as in the larger of the prism;
so exceeding careful has he been in searching out the true
cause of this effect. And he used, I suppose, the greater
caution, because another reason had before been generally
assigned for it.  It was the opinion of all mathematicians,
that this defect in telescopes arose from the figure, in
which the glasses were formed; a spherical refracting surface
not collecting into an exact point all the rays which
come from any one point of an object, as has before been
said<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>.  But after our author has proved, that in these small
refractions, as well as in greater, the sine of incidence into
air out of glass, to the sine of refraction in the red-making
rays, is as 50 to 77, and in the blue-making rays
50 to 78; he proceeds to compare the inequalities of refraction
arising from this different refrangibility of the rays,
with the inequalities, which would follow from the figure
of the glass, were light uniformly refracted. For this purpose
he observes, that if rays issuing from a point so remote
from the object glass of a telescope, as to be esteemed
parallel, which is the case of the rays, which come from the
heavenly bodies; then the distance from the glass of the
point, in which the least refrangible rays are united, will
be to the distance, at which the most refrangible rays unite,
as 28 to 27; and therefore that the least space, into which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
all the rays can be collected, will not be less than the 55th
part of the breadth of the glass. For if A&nbsp;B (in fig. 159) be
the glass, C&nbsp;D its axis, E&nbsp;A, F&nbsp;B two rays of the light parallel
to that axis entring the glass near its edges; after refraction
let the least refrangible part of these rays meet in G,
the most refrangible in H; then, as has been said, G&nbsp;I will
be to I&nbsp;H, as 28 to 27; that is, G&nbsp;H will be the 28th
part of G&nbsp;I, and the 27th part of H&nbsp;I; whence if K&nbsp;L be
drawn through G, and M&nbsp;N through H, perpendicular to
C&nbsp;D, M&nbsp;N will be the a 28th part of A&nbsp;B, the breadth of
the glass, and K&nbsp;L the 27th part of the same; so that O&nbsp;P
the least space, into which the rays are gathered, will be
about half the mean between these two, that is the 55th
part of A&nbsp;B.</p>

<p>20. <span class="smcap gesperrt">This</span> is the error arising from the different refrangibility
of the rays of light, which our author finds
vastly to exceed the other, consequent upon the figure of
the glass. In particular, if the telescope glass be flat on
one side, and convex on the other; when the flat side is
turned towards the object, by a theorem, which he has
laid down, the error from the figure comes out above 5000
times less than the other. This other inequality is so
great, that telescopes could not perform so well as they
do, were it not that the light does not equally fill all the
space O&nbsp;P, over which it is scattered, but is much more dense
toward the middle of that space than at the extremities.
And besides, all the kinds of rays affect not the sense equally
strong, the yellow and orange being the strongest,
the red and green next to them, the blue indigo and violet
being much darker and fainter colours; and it is shewn
that all the yellow and orange, and three fifths of the
brighter half of the red next the orange, and as great a
share of the brighter half of the green next the yellow,
will be collected into a space whose breadth is not above
the 250th part of the breadth of the glass.</p>

<p>And the remaining
colours, which fall without this space, as they are
much more dull and obscure than these, so will they be
likewise much more diffused; and therefore call hardly affect
the sense in comparison of the other. And agreeable
to this is the observation of astronomers, that
telescopes between twenty and sixty feet in length represent
the fixed stars, as being about 5 or 6, at most
about 8 or 10 seconds in diameter. Whereas other arguments
shew us, that they do not really appear to us of any
sensible magnitude any otherwise than as their light is
dilated by refraction. One proof that the fixed stars do
not appear to us under any sensible angle is, that when
the moon passes over any of them, their light does not, like
the planets on the same occasion, disappear by degrees, but
vanishes at once.</p>

<p><a name="c393" id="c393">21.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> author being thus convinced, that telescopes
were not capable of being brought to much greater perfection
than at present by refractions, contrived one by reflection, in
which there is no separation made of the different coloured
light; for in every kind of light the rays after reflection
have the same degree of inclination to the surface, from
whence they are reflected, as they have at their incidence, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
that those rays which come to the surface in one line, will go
off also in one line without any parting from one another. Accordingly
in the attempt he succeeded so well, that a short
one, not much exceeding six inches in length, equalled an ordinary
telescope whose length was four feet. Instruments of
this kind to greater lengths, have of late been made, which

Of the RAINBOW.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap00">I SHALL now explain the rainbow. The manner of its
production was understood, in the general, before Sir
<em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> had discovered his theory of colours; but
what caused the diversity of colours in it could not then be
known, which obliges him to explain this appearance particularly;
whom we shall imitate as follows. The first person,
who expressly shewed the rainbow to be formed by the
reflection of the sun-beams from drops of falling rain,
was <span class="smcap">Antonio de Dominis</span>. But this was afterwards
more fully and distinctly explained by <span class="smcap">DesCartes</span>.</p>

<p><a name="c394b" id="c394b">2.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> appears most frequently two rainbows; both
of which are caused by the foresaid reflection of the sun-beams
from the drops of falling rain, but are not produced
by all the light which falls upon and are reflected
from the drops. The inner bow is produced by those
rays only which enter the drop, and at their entrance are
so refracted as to unite into a point, as it were, upon the farther
surface of the drop, as is represented in fig. 160;
where the contiguous rays <i>a&nbsp;b</i>, <i>c&nbsp;d</i>, <i>e&nbsp;f</i>, coming from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
sun, and therefore to sense parallel, upon their entrance into
the drop in the points <i>b, d, f</i>, are so refracted as to meet
together in the point <i>g</i>, upon the farther surface of the drop.
Now these rays being reflected nearly from the same point
of the surface, the angle of incidence of each ray upon
the point g being equal to the angle of reflection, the
rays will return in the lines <i>g&nbsp;h, g&nbsp;k, g&nbsp;l</i>, in the same manner
inclined to each other, as they were before their incidence
upon the point <i>g</i>, and will make the same angles with
the surface of the drop at the points <i>b, k, l</i>, as at the points
<i>b, d, f</i>, after their entrance; and therefore after their emergence
out of the drop each ray will be inclined to the surface
in the same angle, as when it first entered it; whence
the lines <i>b&nbsp;m, k&nbsp;n, l&nbsp;o</i>, in which the rays emerge, must be
parallel to each other, as well as the lines <i>a&nbsp;b, c&nbsp;d, e&nbsp;f</i>, in
which they were incident. But these emerging rays being
parallel will not spread nor diverge from each other in
their passage from the drop, and therefore will enter the
eye conveniently situated in sufficient plenty to cause a
sensation. Whereas all the other rays, whether those nearer
the center of the drop, as <i>p&nbsp;q, r&nbsp;s</i>, or those farther off, as
<i>t&nbsp;u, w&nbsp;x</i>, will be reflected from other points in the hinder
surface of the drop; namely, the ray <i>p&nbsp;q</i> from the point
<i>y, r&nbsp;s</i> from <i>z, t&nbsp;v</i> from α, and <i>w&nbsp;x</i> from β. And for this
reason by their reflection and succeeding refraction they
will be scattered after their emergence from the forementioned
rays and from each other, and therefore cannot enter
the eye placed to receive them copious enough to excite
any distinct sensation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="c396" id="c396">3.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> external rainbow is formed by two reflections
made between the incidence and emergence of the rays;
for it is to be noted, that the rays <i>g&nbsp;h, g&nbsp;k, g&nbsp;l</i>, at the
points <i>h, k, l</i>, do not wholly pass out of the drop, but
are in part reflected back; though the second reflection
of these particular rays does not form the outer bow.
For this bow is made by those rays, which after their entrance
into the drop are by the refraction of it united, before
they arrive at the farther surface, at such a distance from
it, that when they fall upon that surface, they may be reflected
in parallel lines, as is represented in fig. 161;
where the rays <i>a&nbsp;b, c&nbsp;d, e&nbsp;f</i>, are collected by the refraction
of the drop into the point <i>g</i>, and passing on from thence
strike upon the surface of the drop in the points <i>h, k, l</i>, and
are thence reflected to <i>m, n, o</i>, passing from <i>h</i> to <i>m</i>, from <i>k</i> to
<i>n</i>, and from <i>l</i> to <i>o</i> in parallel lines. For these rays after
reflection at <i>m, n, o</i>, will meet again in the point <i>p</i>, at
the same distance from these points of reflection <i>m, n, o</i>,
as the point <i>g</i> is from the former points of reflection <i>h,
k, l</i>. Therefore these rays in passing from <i>p</i> to the surface
of the drop will fall upon that surface in the points <i>q,
r, s</i> in the same angles, as these rays made with the surface
in <i>b, d, f</i>, after refraction. Consequently, when these rays
emerge out of the drop into the air, each ray will make
with the surface of the drop the same angle, as it made at
its first incidence; so that the lines <i>q&nbsp;t, r&nbsp;v, s&nbsp;w</i>, in which
they come from the drop, will be parallel to each other, as
well as the lines <i>a&nbsp;b, c&nbsp;d, e&nbsp;f</i>, in which they came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
drop. By this means these rays to a spectator commodiously
situated will become visible. But all the other rays, as well
those nearer the center of the drop <i>x&nbsp;y</i>, <i>z</i>&nbsp;α, as those more
remote from it β&nbsp;γ, δ&nbsp;ε, will be reflected in lines not parallel
to the lines <i>h&nbsp;m, k&nbsp;n, l&nbsp;o</i>; namely, the ray <i>x&nbsp;y</i>, in the
line ζ&nbsp;η, the ray ϰ&nbsp;α in the line θ&nbsp;ϰ, the ray β&nbsp;γ in the line
λ&nbsp;μ, and the ray δ&nbsp;ε in the line ν&nbsp;χ. Whence these rays
after their next reflection and subsequent refraction will be
scattered from the forementioned rays, and from one another,
and by that means become invisible.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap gesperrt">It</span> is farther to be remarked, that if in the first case
the incident rays <i>a&nbsp;b, c&nbsp;d, e&nbsp;f</i>, and their correspondent emergent
rays <i>h&nbsp;m, k&nbsp;n, l&nbsp;o</i>, are produced till they meet,
they will make with each other a greater angle, than any
other incident ray will make with its corresponding emergent
ray. And in the latter case, on the contrary, the emergent
rays <i>q&nbsp;t, r&nbsp;v, s&nbsp;w</i> make with the incident rays an
acuter angle, than is made by any other of the emergent
rays.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Our</span> author delivers a method of finding each of
these extream angles from the degree of refraction being
given; by which method it appears, that the first of these
angles is the less, and the latter the greater, by how much
the refractive power of the drop, or the refrangibility of
the rays is greater. And this last consideration fully compleats
the doctrine of the rainbow, and shews, why the colours
of each bow are ranged in the order wherein they
are seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Suppose</span> A (in fig. 162.) to be the eye, B, C, D, E, F, drops
of rain, M&nbsp;<i>n</i>, O&nbsp;<i>p</i>, Q&nbsp;<i>r</i>, S&nbsp;<i>t</i>, V&nbsp;<i>w</i> parcels of rays of the sun,
which entring the drops B, C, D, E, F after one reflection
pass out to the eye in A. Now let M&nbsp;<i>n</i> be produced to η
till it meets with the emergent ray likewise produced, let
O&nbsp;<i>p</i> produced meet its emergent ray produced in ϰ, let
Q&nbsp;<i>r</i> meet its emergent ray in λ, let S&nbsp;<i>t</i> meet its emergent
ray in μ, and let V&nbsp;<i>w</i> meet its emergent ray produced in ν. If
the angle under M&nbsp;η&nbsp;A be that, which is derived from the
refraction of the violet-making rays by the method we have
here spoken of, it follows that the violet light will only
enter the eye from the drop B, all the other coloured rays
passing below it, that is, all those rays which are not
scattered, but go out parallel so as to cause a sensation. For
the angle, which these parallel emergent rays makes with
the incident in the most refrangible or violet-making rays,
being less than this angle in any other sort of rays, none of
the rays which emerge parallel, except the violet-making,
will enter the eye under the angle M&nbsp;η&nbsp;A, but the rest making
with the incident ray M&nbsp;η a greater angle than this will
pass below the eye. In like manner if the angle under O&nbsp;ϰ&nbsp;A
agrees to the blue-making rays, the blue rays only shall enter
the eye from the drop C, and all the other coloured rays
will pass by the eye, the violet-coloured rays passing above,
the other colours below. Farther, the angle Q&nbsp;λ&nbsp;A corresponding
to the green-making rays, those only shall enter
the eye from the drop D, the violet and blue-making rays
passing above, and the other colours, that is the yellow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
red, below. And if the angle S&nbsp;μ&nbsp;A answers to the refraction
of the yellow-making rays, they only shall come to
the eye from the drop E. And in the last place, if the angle
V&nbsp;ν&nbsp;A belongs to the red-making and least refrangible
rays, they only shall enter the eye from the drop F, all the
other coloured rays passing above.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap gesperrt">But</span> now it is evident, that all the drops of water
found in any of the lines A&nbsp;ϰ, A&nbsp;λ, A&nbsp;μ, A&nbsp;ν, whether farther
from the eye, or nearer than the drops B, C, D, E, F, will
give the same colours as these do, all the drops upon each
line giving the same colour; so that the light reflected from
a number of these drops will become copious enough to be
visible; whereas the reflection from one minute drop alone
could not be perceived. But besides, it is farther manifest,
that if the line A&nbsp;Ξ be drawn from the sun through the eye,
that is, parallel to the lines M&nbsp;<i>n</i>, O&nbsp;<i>p</i>, Q&nbsp;<i>r</i>, S&nbsp;<i>t</i>, V&nbsp;<i>w</i>, and
if drops of water are placed all round this line, the same
colour will be exhibited by all the drops at the same distance
from this line. Hence it follows, that when the sun is
moderately elevated above the horizon, if it rains opposite
to it, and the sun shines upon the drops as they fall, a
spectator with his back turned to the sun must observe a coloured
circular arch reaching to the horizon, being red without,
next to that yellow, then green, blue, and on the inner
edge violet; only this last colour appears faint by being
diluted with the white light of the clouds, and from another
cause to be mentioned hereafter<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Thus</span> is caused the interior or primary bow. The
drops of rain at some distance without this bow will cause
the exterior or secondary bow by two reflections of the sun’s
light. Let these drops be G, H, I, K, L; X&nbsp;<i>y</i>, Z&nbsp;α, Γ&nbsp;β,
Δ&nbsp;ι, Θ&nbsp;ζ denoting parcels of rays which enter each drop.
Now it has been remarked, that these rays make with the
visible refracted rays the greatest angle in those rays, which
are most refrangible. Suppose therefore the visible refracted
rays, which pass out from each drop after two reflections, and
enter the eye in A, to intersect the incident rays in π, ρ, σ, τ,
φ respectively. It is manifest, that the angle under Θ&nbsp;φ&nbsp;A is
the greatest of all, next to that the angle under Δ&nbsp;τ&nbsp;A,
the next in bigness will be the angle under Γ&nbsp;σ&nbsp;A, the next
to this the angle under Z&nbsp;ρ&nbsp;A, and the least of all the angle
under X&nbsp;π&nbsp;A. From the drop L therefore will come to
the eye the violet-making, or most refrangible rays, from
K the blue, from I the green, from H the yellow, and
from G the red-making rays; and the like will happen to
all the drops in the lines A&nbsp;π, A&nbsp;ρ, A&nbsp;τ, A&nbsp;φ, and also to all
the drops at the same distances from the line A&nbsp;Ξ all round
that line. Whence appears the reason of the secondary
bow, which is seen without the other, having its colours
in a contrary order, violet without and red within;
though the colours are fainter than in the other bow, as being
made by two reflections, and two refractions; whereas
the other bow is made by two refractions, and one reflection
only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="c401" id="c401">9.</a> <span class="smcap gesperrt">There</span> is a farther appearance in the rainbow particularly
described about five years ago<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>, which is, that under the
upper part or the inner bow there appears often two or
three orders of very faint colours, making alternate arches
of green, and a reddish purple. At the time this appearance
was taken notice of, I gave my thoughts concerning the
cause of it<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>, which I shall here repeat. Sir <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em>
has observed, that in glass, which is polished and quick-silvered,
there is an irregular refraction made, whereby some
small quantity of light is scattered from the principal reflected
beam<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>. If we allow the same thing to happen in the
reflection whereby the rainbow is caused, it seems sufficient
to produce the appearance now mentioned.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap gesperrt">Let</span> A&nbsp;B (in fig. 162.) represent a globule of water,
B the point from whence the rays of any determinate species
being reflected to C, and afterwards emerging in the
line C&nbsp;D, would proceed to the eye, and cause the appearance
of that colour in the rainbow, which appertains to
this species. Here suppose, that besides what is reflected regularly,
some small part of the light is irregularly scattered
every way; so that from the point B, besides the rays
that are regularly reflected from B to C, some scattered rays
will return in other lines, as in B&nbsp;E, B&nbsp;F, B&nbsp;G, B&nbsp;H, on
each side the line B&nbsp;C. Now it has been observed above<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>,
that the rays of light in their passage from one superficies
of a refracting body to the other undergo alternate fits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
easy transmission and reflection, succeeding each other at
equal intervals; insomuch that if they reach the farther superficies
in one sort of those fits, they shall be transmitted;
if in the other kind of them, they shall rather be reflected
back. Whence the rays that proceed from B to C, and
emerge in the line C&nbsp;D, being in a fit of easy transmission,
the scattered rays, that fall at a small distance without these
on either side (suppose the rays that pass in the lines B&nbsp;E,
B&nbsp;G) shall fall on the surface in a fit of easy reflection, and
shall not emerge; but the scattered rays, that pass at some
distance without these last, shall arrive at the surface of the
globule in a fit of easy transmission, and break through that
surface. Suppose these rays to pass in the lines B&nbsp;F, B&nbsp;H;
the former of which rays shall have had one fit more of easy
transmission, and the latter one fit less, than the rays that
pass from B to C. Now both these rays, when they go out
of the globule, will proceed by the refraction of the water
In the lines F&nbsp;I, H&nbsp;K, that will be inclined almost equally to
the rays incident on the globule, which come from the sun; but
the angles of their inclination will be less than the angle, in
which the rays emerging in the line C&nbsp;D are inclined to
those incident rays. And after the same manner rays scattered
from the point B at a certain distance without these
will emerge out of the globule, while the intermediate rays
are intercepted; and these emergent rays will be inclined
to the rays incident on the globule in angles still less than
the angles, in which the rays F&nbsp;I and H&nbsp;K are inclined to
them; and without these rays will emerge other rays, that
shall be inclined to the incident rays in angles yet less.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>Now by this means may be formed of every kind of rays, besides
the principal arch, which goes to the formation of the rainbow,
other arches within every one of the principal of the
same colour, though much more faint; and this for divers
successions, as long as these weak lights, which in every
arch grow more and more obscure, shall continue visible.
Now as the arches produced by each colour will be variously
mixed together, the diversity of colours observ’d in
these secondary arches may very possibly arise from them.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap gesperrt">In</span> the darker colours these arches may reach below
the bow, and be seen distinct. In the brighter colours these
arches are lost in the inferior part of the principal light of the
rainbow; but in all probability they contribute to the red tincture,
which the purple of the rainbow usually has, and is most
remarkable when these secondary colours appear strongest.
However these secondary arches in the brightest colours may
possibly extend with a very faint light below the bow, and
tinge the purple of these secondary arches with a reddish hue.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> precise distances between the principal arch
and these fainter arches depend on the magnitude of the
drops, wherein they are formed. To make them any degree
separate it is necessary the drop be exceeding small. It is
most likely, that they are formed in the vapour of the cloud,
which the air being put in motion by the fall of the rain
may carry down along with the larger drops; and this may
be the reason, why these colours appear under the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
part of the bow only, this vapour not descending very low.
As a farther confirmation of this, these colours are seen
strongest, when the rain falls from very black clouds, which
cause the fiercest rains, by the fall whereof the air will be
most agitated.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap gesperrt">To</span> the like alternate return of the fits of easy transmission
and reflection in the passage of light through the
globules of water, which compose the clouds, Sir <span class="smcap">Isaac
Newton</span> ascribes some of those coloured circles, which
at times appear about the sun and moon<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>.</p>

</div>
<p class="cap13">SIR <em class="gesperrt"><span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span></em> having concluded
each of his philosophical treatises with
some general reflections, I shall now
take leave of my readers with a short
account of what he has there delivered.
At the end of his mathematical principles
of natural philosophy he has
given us his thoughts concerning the Deity. Wherein he
first observes, that the similitude found in all parts of the
universe makes it undoubted, that the whole is governed by
one supreme being, to whom the original is owing of the
frame of nature, which evidently is the effect of choice
and design. He then proceeds briefly to state the best metaphysical
notions concerning God. In short, we cannot
conceive either of space or time otherwise than as necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
existing; this Being therefore, on whom all others depend,
must certainly exist by the same necessity of nature.
Consequently wherever space and time is found, there God
must also be. And as it appears impossible to us, that space
should be limited, or that time should have had a beginning,
the Deity must be both immense and eternal.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap gesperrt">At</span> the end of his treatise of optics he has proposed
some thoughts concerning other parts of nature, which he
had not distinctly searched into. He begins with some
farther reflections concerning light, which he had not fully
examined. In particular he declares his sentiments at large
concerning the power, whereby bodies and light act on each
other. In some parts of his book he had given short hints
at his opinion concerning this<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>, but here he expressly declares
his conjecture, which we have already mentioned<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>,
that this power is lodged in a very subtle spirit of a great elastic
force diffused thro’ the universe, producing not only this, but
many other natural operations. He thinks it not impossible,
that the power of gravity itself should be owing to it. On
this occasion he enumerates many natural appearances, the
chief of which are produced by chymical experiments. From
numerous observations of this kind he makes no doubt, that
the smallest parts of matter, when near contact, act strongly
on each other, sometimes being mutually attracted, at other
times repelled.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap gesperrt">The</span> attractive power is more manifest than the other,
for the parts of all bodies adhere by this principle. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
name of attraction, which our author has given to it, has
been very freely made use of by many writers, and as much
objected to by others. He has often complained to
me of having been misunderstood in this matter. What
he lays upon this head was not intended by him as a philosophical
explanation of any appearances, but only to point
out a power in nature not hitherto distinctly observed, the
cause of which, and the manner of its acting, he thought
was worthy of a diligent enquiry. To acquiesce in the
explanation of any appearance by asserting it to be a general
power of attraction, is not to improve our knowledge in
philosophy, but rather to put a stop to our farther search.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
